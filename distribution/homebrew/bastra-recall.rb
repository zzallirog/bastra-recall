# bastra-recall — Homebrew formula
#
# THIS FILE IS THE SOURCE OF TRUTH for everything EXCEPT `url` and `sha256`.
# The live copy lives in https://github.com/n0mad-ai/homebrew-tap as
# Formula/bastra-recall.rb.
#
# `url` / `sha256` down there are bumped automatically by the tap's own
# .github/workflows/update-formula.yml on every stable release — never copy
# the two lines from here, this file's version deliberately lags behind.
# Everything else (build steps, bin shims, caveats) is authored HERE and has to
# be copied over by hand. The two drifted apart once (the tap sat on v0.7.6 and
# was missing six of the seven hook shims), and again in the caveat's client
# list (#525); keep them in lockstep. `npm run check:tap-drift` compares the two
# and the `formula drift` workflow runs it daily — a failure there is fixed in
# the tap, never here.
#
# Install via:
#   brew tap n0mad-ai/tap
#   brew trust n0mad-ai/tap   # current brew refuses untrusted third-party taps
#   brew install bastra-recall
#   bastra install all

    <<~EOS
      Finish setup with:
        bastra install all

      That registers bastra-recall with every supported AI client
      (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex/ChatGPT Desktop, Cursor) and verifies the install.

      The MCP forwarder auto-starts the daemon on first use, and it shuts
      down again after 30 minutes idle. That is all Claude Code, Claude
      Desktop, Codex/ChatGPT Desktop and Cursor need.

      To keep it running permanently (REST clients, warm embedding model):
        bastra autostart on
        bastra autostart off    # back to on-demand

      After a plain 'brew upgrade' the running daemon keeps the OLD code in
      memory — Homebrew does not know about it. Either use:
        bastra update           # upgrade + re-register + restart, all in one
      or restart the daemon yourself. 'bastra doctor' says when the running
      daemon is older than what is installed.

      Vault path: pass --vault, set BASTRA_VAULT_PATH, or let the CLI
      auto-detect from an existing claude.json registration.
