/**
 * #554 — `dist/.build-revision` must pack byte-identical across two builds of
 * the same commit, or a resumed publish can never match.
 *
 * `scripts/publish-release-set.mjs` skips an already-published package only
 * after comparing a fresh `npm pack --dry-run` digest of this checkout
 * against the registry's tarball (`packDigest` / `mismatchReason`, #524).
 * `.build-revision` ships inside that tarball. Before this fix it carried a
 * `built_at=<ISO>` timestamp, so two builds of the identical tree — the
 * original publish and a rerun seconds or days later — produced two
 * different digests and the resume that #524 exists for could never work
 * (v1.0.0 hit exactly this and had to be finished by hand).
 *
 * `scripts/write-build-revision.mjs` derives its repo root from its OWN file
 * location (`dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url))/..`), not from `cwd` or
 * an argument — so this test copies the script into a throwaway git repo
 * shaped like `<repo>/scripts/write-build-revision.mjs` rather than pointing
 * it at a fixture directory.
 *
 * Runner: node --test tools/__tests__/write-build-revision-deterministic-554.test.mjs
