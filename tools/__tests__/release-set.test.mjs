/**
 * #524 — the stable release recipe must not create a prerelease, and npm
 * publication of the four-package set must be resumable.
 *
 * Two halves of one failure:
 *
 * 1. `scripts/bump.mjs` printed `gh release create … --prerelease` for EVERY
 *    version. The publish workflow publishes npm under `latest` on any release,
 *    while the Homebrew tap updater and both one-click installers read GitHub
 *    `/releases/latest`, which excludes prereleases — so following the printed
 *    command for 1.0.0 would have put npm on 1.0.0 and left every non-developer
 *    install path on 0.9.2. A stable version now gets a stable command, and the
 *    staging object is a DRAFT: `--latest=false` only held `/releases/latest`
 *    back, while the release page and the tag were public from creation and
 *    stayed that way through every asset job and a still-failable npm publish.
 *    A draft has no page and no tag; both come into existence in `promote`,
 *    after the whole set is verified. A draft fires no release event either, so
 *    the workflow is started explicitly with the draft's tag instead.
 *
 * 2. Four independent `npm publish` steps against an immutable registry: a
 *    failure in the third left the first two published, and the rerun died on
 *    the first one. `scripts/publish-release-set.mjs` preflights every target,
 *    skips a package only after verifying the published artifact is this
 *    release — name, version, internal pins AND tarball digest, because another
 *    commit can match every field of the manifest and still ship other bytes —
 *    and publishes the rest with the unscoped wrapper last.
 *
 * The publish half runs against a stub `npm` on PATH — no registry is touched,
 * nothing is published, and the assertions are on which publishes the script
 * would have issued, in which order.
 *
 * Runner: node --test tools/__tests__/release-set.test.mjs
