/**
 * #535 — the one-click installers must not report success after a failed upgrade.
 *
 * Both public entry points (`distribution/install.sh` and the Finder
 * `distribution/Install Bastra.command`) deliberately survive a failing
 * `brew upgrade bastra-recall`: the already-installed version keeps working, so
 * aborting hard would be worse than useless. What they used to do afterwards was
 * the bug — run the guided setup against the OLD binary and, when those checks
 * passed, print the unconditional `✓ Done.` banner and exit 0. A user coming from
 * the 1.0 release page was told the install had succeeded while still on 0.9.x.
 *
 * The scripts are driven here with a stub `brew`, a stub `curl` for the release
 * API and a healthy stub `bastra` (install/doctor/status all green), in an
 * isolated HOME, so the assertions are about the scripts alone: distinct
 * incomplete wording, non-zero exit, and — the part that matters for a machine
 * that is still running fine — no re-registration against a version that never
 * landed.
 *
 * A failing `brew upgrade` was only the loud half. The quiet half is an upgrade
 * that exits 0 and changes nothing: a stale tap, or a keg Homebrew already
 * considers current. The first fix compared the CLI version only when `brew
 * outdated --verbose` had produced an expectation, and that command prints
 * nothing in exactly those cases — so the check was skipped and the run ended in
 * the success banner with the CLI still on 0.9.2. Worse, the "successful
 * upgrade" test below stubbed precisely that shape and asserted success, which
 * cemented the bug instead of catching it. The expectation is now taken from an
 * authoritative source (the release this installer comes from) and verified
 * after an upgrade AND after a fresh install; the green test correspondingly
 * requires the CLI to actually end up on the requested version.
 *
 * Runner: node --test tools/__tests__/installer-upgrade-failure.test.mjs
