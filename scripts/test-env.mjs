/**
 * Test-run isolation for anything that writes user data.
 *
 * `new Telemetry()` resolves its log dir at construction: BASTRA_LOG_PATH, else
 * ~/.bastra/logs. 22 test files construct one without redirecting it, so a plain
 * `npm test` appended 114 real telemetry events to the developer's own log —
 * 63 save_memory, 25 recall, 2 recall_episode carrying the fixture id "m1".
 *
 * That is not cosmetic. The event log is an INPUT: `bastra logs --stats` reports
 * from it, and `bastra bridges mint` mines it for (query → acted-on memory) reaches
 * and writes the resulting bridges into the Commons clone. Fixture rows in that log
 * become fixture bridges staged for contribution, and every measurement taken over
 * the log is contaminated by however many times the suite happened to run.
 *
 * Fixing this per-file would need 22 edits and would silently regress the next time
 * someone adds a 23rd. Redirecting once, here, closes the class: a test process
 * that did not deliberately choose a log dir gets a throwaway one. Files that set
 * BASTRA_LOG_PATH themselves are untouched — this only fills in the default.
 *
 * Wired via `--import` in the root `test` script, so it applies to every per-file
 * test process the runner spawns.
 *
 * The second thing it closes is #414: inside a test child, stdout is not a
 * console. It is the pipe that carries the runner's v8-serialized result frames,
 * and Node <= 22.23.2 / 24.19.0 read a frame length signed — so one non-ASCII
 * byte landing where a length is expected crashes the parent's decoder
 * (nodejs/node#64061, measured in #383: 9 of 20 full-suite runs). 26 daemon test
 * files import from `src/cli/`, 15 CLI modules print `✓ …` status lines, and six
 * test files guard against it by hand. Guarding the 27th is a convention nobody
 * can enforce; the pipe itself can be.

/**
 * One temp root per test run, and the developer's own bastra settings kept out.
 *
 * Only the FIRST process that imports this file does the setup — the runner, or
 * a lone `node --import … -e`. It exports BASTRA_TEST_RUN_ROOT, so every test
 * child it spawns (and whatever those spawn) sees the setup as already done:
 * a variable a child has at that point was put there by a test on purpose.
 *
 * The temp root. TMPDIR/TEMP/TMP point into a directory this process removes
 * when it exits, on a signal as well, so every `mkdtemp(tmpdir())` anywhere in
 * the run is cleaned up with it. One run used to leave its directories behind
 * for good — measured: 953 `bastra-test-eval-runs-*` + 951 `bastra-test-logs-*`
 * in a Linux /tmp, 767 `bastra-*` in a Windows %TEMP% (no reboot sweep there),
 * and a further 76 from individual test files after those two were fixed.
 *
 * The settings. CI exports none of them, so the suite is green there and was
 * red on any machine where bastra is in use: BASTRA_VAULT_PATH from a shell
 * profile sent `arm-plumbing`'s spawned CLI into the real vault (`0 !== 100`),
 * and BASTRA_OLLAMA_URL, BASTRA_EMBEDDING_*, BASTRA_HOOK_STATE_DIR, … select a
 * model or point at real state the same way. Every BASTRA_* / NEXUS_* input is
 * dropped. Two OUTPUT locations are the exception, with their old contract
 * (#420): a caller who chose BASTRA_LOG_PATH or BASTRA_EVAL_RUNS_DIR keeps it.
 * `BASTRA_TEST_KEEP_ENV=1` keeps everything, for a deliberate run against a
 * chosen vault.
