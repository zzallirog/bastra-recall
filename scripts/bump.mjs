/**
 * bump.mjs — set a new version across all workspace packages AND keep the
 * internal cross-dependency pins in lockstep.
 *
 * Why: `npm version --workspaces` bumps each package's own version but does
 * NOT rewrite the internal pins (e.g. the daemon's `"@bastra-recall/core":
 * "0.7.0-beta.1"`), so a publish would resolve a stale dependency version.
 * This rewrites the version of every workspace + root and every dependency
 * entry that points at an internal package, in one shot.
 *
 *   node scripts/bump.mjs <version> [--dry-run]
 *
 * Example:
 *   node scripts/bump.mjs 0.7.0-beta.2 --dry-run   # preview only
 *   node scripts/bump.mjs 0.7.0-beta.2             # apply
 *
 * Does NOT touch git — commit, tag and `gh release create` stay manual.

// bump.mjs originally only touched package.json and the constants shipped
// stale. That kept failing in a quieter way: on the 0.8.9 bump it ran over
// part of the tree only, so cli/helpers.ts said 0.8.9 while index.ts still
// said 0.8.8 — and the daemon reported 0.8.8 in /health, in the MCP handshake,
// and to the update check, which then compared the wrong version against the
// published one.
//
// The constants now read package.json at runtime (packages/daemon/src/version.ts),
// so there is nothing left to rewrite. What remains is making sure nobody
// reintroduces a literal: bumping the package must stay the only way to bump
// the daemon.

// 4) The release handoff (#524).
//
// This used to end in `gh release create … --prerelease` for every version,
// stable ones included. That is the one release kind that keeps the primary
// non-developer install path stale: the publish workflow publishes npm under
// `latest` on any release, while the Homebrew tap updater and the one-click
// installers read GitHub `/releases/latest`, which excludes prereleases.
// Following the printed command for 1.0.0 would have shipped npm 1.0.0 while
// Homebrew and the Finder installer stayed on 0.9.2.
//
// So the flag now follows the semver: `--prerelease` only when the version
// itself has a prerelease component.
//
// The staging object is a DRAFT. `--latest=false` was not enough: it keeps
// `/releases/latest` (and with it the tap and both installers) from moving
// early, but the release page and its tag are public from the moment the
// release is created — while the asset jobs are still running and the npm
// publication can still fail. A draft has no public page and creates no tag at
// all; both come into existence in the workflow's `promote` job, after the
// complete set has been verified.
//
// A draft fires no `release: published`, so the workflow is no longer hung off
// the release event: it is started explicitly with the tag of the draft
// (`workflow_dispatch`), which is also the only way the jobs can attach assets
// to something that is not public yet.
