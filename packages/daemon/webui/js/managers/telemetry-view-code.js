/**
 * #589 — code awareness, both halves. Split out of telemetry-view.js under
 * #601 once that file reached the size ceiling — this section is a coherent
 * unit on its own (one question, one report object) and was already set off
 * by its own heading comment there.
 *
 * The block half is the cost the Write/Edit lane pays without being asked; the
 * tool half is what an agent asked for on purpose. Wording mirrors the CLI
 * section (src/cli/log-stats-code.ts) and both read the same folds, so a figure
 * cannot appear in one readout and not the other.
