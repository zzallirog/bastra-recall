/**
 * commit-pool.ts — the #135 corpus-commitment clause for the #129 contribution gate.
 *
 * Run it two ways:
 *   npx tsx packages/daemon/scripts/commit-pool.ts            # commit YOUR real #121 log (Tier B)
 *   npx tsx packages/daemon/scripts/commit-pool.ts --days 7   #   ...last 7 days
 *   npx tsx packages/daemon/scripts/commit-pool.ts --synthetic # the leak/closure PROOF (Tier A)
 *
 * ── Why this exists ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * #129/#131 certify that a harvested bridge lifts the OUT-OF-POOL far slice (real transfer, not
 * in-pool reorder), drawing the held-out split from the #121 candidate-pool log. #135 names a leak
 * one level UNDER the split: the held-out set is sampled FROM that log, but the log is produced by
 * the SAME side that mints the bridge. A net-harmful bridge (+far / -near) is rejected only if its
 * near-regressions are IN the log to be sampled. Omit those queries before scoring and the held-out
 * set can't contain what it never saw — the bridge shows pure far-lift, no visible regression, and
 * clears the gate. (#89 own-trigger circularity two layers up: the attested party authors the
 * evidence corpus it's judged on.)
 *
 * daniel confirmed the boundary (#135 reply): LOCALLY the leak can't fire — harvest.ts inherits log
 * membership from every recall, it never chooses it (extractCandidatePools reads ALL recall/
 * hook_recall events). The leak is born at `contribute`, where a FOREIGN bridge arrives carrying its
 * author's bookkeeping. So the closure is modeled at the trust boundary (--synthetic); the real log
 * only needs the commitment computed over it (default run).
 *
 * ── The commitment ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Before any bridge is scored, COMMIT the candidate-pool log: a canonical hash, published + fixed
 * before eval. A contributed bridge ships {committedLogHash, foldMap, farLift, nearRegression}. The
 * recipient (a) verifies the shipped scores were computed against the committed log (re-hashes it),
 * and (b) RE-CHECKS the bridge on ITS OWN pool — so the verdict never trusts the contributor's
 * corpus, only re-runs the protocol against a corpus that can't have shifted after the fact, and
 * against the recipient's near slice the author cannot omit.
 *
 * ── Honest scope (load-bearing) ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   • No empirical lift claim — protocol proposal. The deltas in --synthetic are ILLUSTRATIVE
 *     (the issue's +30-far/-50-near model as ±1 unit moves), not bastra magnitudes.
 *   • Tier A (--synthetic) validates the GATE LOGIC: that committing the log + recipient re-check
 *     removes the author's freedom to omit regressions. Tier B (real log) emits the commitment over
 *     your vault; it does NOT prove closure (one vault has no contribute boundary to leak across).
 *   • foldOf() is the #129 SPEC split (hash(query)→fold) — #129 is OPEN, the k-fold is not yet in
 *     core. This harness slots beside that spec; `contribute` stays unwired until both the split
 *     (#129/#131) and this commitment exist.
 *   • drand fold-seed is OUT of scope: the load-bearing leak is corpus MEMBERSHIP, not the seed
 *     (#135) — a clean drop-in at the same point later (Bellard: don't build the second instrument first).
