/**
 * End-to-end: the shared learned-recall bridge layer (#120) wired through the real
 * recallHandler. Proves the product-visible behavior:
 *   1. a far-worded (different vocabulary) query that finds nothing on its own
 *      DOES find the memory once a language-matched bridge widens it;
 *   2. with the layer off (no pool), the same query finds nothing — so the lift
 *      is attributable to the bridge, not the index;
 *   3. #707: the language folder is not a gate — a bridge filed under another
 *      folder ("und") lifts the query too; only a configured language override
 *      restricts the pool, and that restriction holds through the handler;
 *   4. owner decision 2026-09-29: a pool that is not live (the default) leaves
 *      the ranking untouched and still writes the `bridge_expansion` row.
 *      The lift tests above load their pool live.
 *
 * Run: npx tsx --test packages/daemon/__tests__/learned-recall-integration.test.ts
