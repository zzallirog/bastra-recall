/**
 * #305 — which lane a CLIENT row says it belongs to.
 *
 * The stub writes its own telemetry row for the calls the daemon cannot log,
 * and that row names a lane. Twice now that name was wrong, with the same
 * consequence both times: a failure counted against a lane it did not happen
 * in, and the lane it DID happen in looking healthy.
 *
 *   · the prompt branch wrote `detected_mode: "none"`, so every client-side
 *     prompt failure landed in the silent lane (fixed earlier in #305)
 *   · `bash-pre` and `bash-fail` fell into the write lane's branch and wrote
 *     `kind: "hook_call"`, so every client-side failure of the two Bash lanes
 *     was filed under Write/Edit — and the two Bash gates, which #305 had just
 *     armed, could not turn red for anything the client sees
 *
 * The stub is compiled with `deno compile`, but the file runs unchanged on
 * node, so the row is produced here for real instead of being described.
 *
 * Runner: npm test (never `npx tsx --test` directly — that bypasses
 * scripts/test-env.mjs and writes into the real telemetry log).
