/**
 * The Telemetry tab must be able to name every `unavailable` reason (#589).
 *
 * The tab turns a reason code into a sentence a human can act on. A code with no
 * entry falls back to the raw token, which is not wrong but is exactly the kind
 * of silent gap this section exists to close: `degraded` means "a defect, run
 * bastra doctor" and `cold` means "nothing is wrong, ask again" — printing both
 * as a bare identifier hides the difference.
 *
 * So this pins the label map against the reason codes the classifier can
 * produce. No DOM, like telemetry-view-suppression.test.ts.
 *
 * Runner: `node --import tsx --test packages/daemon/__tests__/telemetry-view-code.test.ts`
