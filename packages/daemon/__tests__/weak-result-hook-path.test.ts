/**
 * #249 — the "nothing really matched" flag has to reach the hook path.
 *
 * `/api/v1/recall` reported `weak_result`; `/hook/recall` never formed it. That
 * is the path writing `<recall-hints>` into the agent's context on every Bash
 * and Edit, so the formatters labelled everything above the threshold "Strong
 * matches" — including hits that only ranked first because a list always has a
 * first element. In a live session the same unrelated memories surfaced at
 * 150-160 for every `rm -rf` and every file edit.
 *
 * The measurement that made it urgent: over 3,126 real recalls in a week,
 * `weak_result: true` appeared **zero** times. Not because recall was healthy —
 * because the hook path never formed it and nothing wrote it to telemetry.
 *
 * Runner: `tsx --test __tests__/weak-result-hook-path.test.ts`

// both-arms pair on the wrong document — engine-invisible, client-side) and

// detectable from the score, and only via the rank pair — a "flat score
// distribution" heuristic INVERTS on real data, because a genuine home spikes
// to the both-arms ceiling with siblings crowding just behind it.
