/**
 * #472/#473 — the four surfaces that grant recall and save authority must not
 * contradict each other.
 *
 * A fresh client can load any subset of: the MCP `initialize` instructions,
 * the skill, the `recall`/`save_memory` tool descriptions, and the session
 * context inject. Each is hand-authored, none was compared against the others,
 * so they could drift into a split-brain about write authority over the user's
 * vault — which is exactly what `origin/fix/bounded-mcp-instructions` (44619f4)
 * did on the MCP entry alone. #473 decided that direction is rejected: the
 * policy is proactive on all four surfaces.
 *
 * The check is semantic-by-keyword, NOT byte equality. The surfaces legitimately
 * differ in length and wording; what they may not do is disagree on
 *   1. when `recall` is expected (proactive vs. only on explicit request),
 *   2. whether live sources outrank recall for current state,
 *   3. whether `save_memory` may fire without a human ask.
 *
 * `BOUNDED_FIXTURE` below is the rejected branch text verbatim. It is here so
 * this test is verified against a real contradiction instead of only against
 * the green status quo: the last two tests prove the classifier reads it as the
 * opposite policy and that parity fails when it is one of the four surfaces.
 *
 * Run: npx tsx --test packages/daemon/__tests__/recall-policy-parity.test.ts
