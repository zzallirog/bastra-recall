/**
 * doctor checks the paths its hooks execute, not just that they are there (#321).
 *
 * Found in the VM verifying #304: after an update from 0.8.8 one of seven
 * Claude Code hooks still pointed at `~/.bastra/runtime/0.8.8/…`, and doctor
 * reported `hooks: 7/7 registered` + `ok`. The check that detects exactly this
 * shape had existed since #304 — it was applied to the MCP forwarder path and
 * to nothing else, so the surface ran replaced code and said it was healthy.
 *
 * The scenario reproduced here is that exact settings.json state.
 *
 * Runner: `node --import tsx --test packages/daemon/__tests__/doctor-hook-paths.test.ts`
