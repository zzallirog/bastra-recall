/**
 * Tests for `bastra logs --stats` (#279 slice) — the readout that made the
 * hook-budget loss visible.
 *
 * The aggregation exists because averaging over all events lied: the `none`
 * lane never recalls, so its 4ms median dragged the mean far below what the
 * recalling lanes actually cost. These tests pin the two properties that
 * matter — lanes stay separate, and a call still counts as a call when it was
 * gated, suppressed or timed out.
 *
 * Run: npx tsx --test packages/daemon/__tests__/log-stats.test.ts
