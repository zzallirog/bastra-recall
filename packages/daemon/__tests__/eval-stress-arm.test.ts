/**
 * Arm-plumbing guard for the stress harness (#261, M0 gate "no silent arm
 * fallback").
 *
 * The bug this pins: `--hybrid` used to ask `search.hasEmbeddings()` while
 * nothing ever called `useEmbeddings()`, so the answer was always false and the
 * harness reported BM25 numbers under a hybrid label — `stress-report.md` even
 * printed "Search provider: BM25-only" for a run invoked with `--hybrid`. Every
 * measurement taken through that flag was mislabelled, and every gate that
 * rests on those measurements rested on nothing.
 *
 * The guard is the negative case, because it needs no Ollama and it is the one
 * that must never regress: with the provider unreachable the run ABORTS. A
 * harness that quietly measures the wrong arm is worse than one that refuses.
 *
 * Run: npx tsx --test packages/daemon/__tests__/eval-stress-arm.test.ts
