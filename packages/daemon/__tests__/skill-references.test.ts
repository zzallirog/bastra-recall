/**
 * Guards the skill split (#232): SKILL.md carries triggers and points at four
 * reference files, and the gated subsystems name their reference file inside
 * the gate signal itself.
 *
 * The failure this prevents is silent. A renamed or deleted reference leaves a
 * pointer that resolves to nothing, and a reference nobody points at is never
 * read — neither breaks a build, a type check, or any other test. So the
 * pointers get checked as data.
 *
 * Run: npx tsx --test packages/daemon/__tests__/skill-references.test.ts
