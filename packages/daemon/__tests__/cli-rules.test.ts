/**
 * `bastra rules cursor` (#7) — the Cursor convention layer, per project.
 *
 * The design constraint this encodes: Cursor has no global rules file. User
 * Rules live in its settings UI, project rules are `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` in
 * the repo. So this command writes into a directory the user named, and
 * `bastra install` never writes rules into whatever happened to be the
 * working directory.
 *
 * Runner: `tsx --test __tests__/cli-rules.test.ts`
