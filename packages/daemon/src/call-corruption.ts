/**

 * loop. Detection is deliberately narrow: required fields must be absent and
 * the surviving string must contain structural tags for at least two of them.
 *
 * #482: this is a TRANSPORT failure, not a save failure — it hits every tool
 * with more than one parameter in exactly the same way. `save_memory` is only
 * where it was noticed, because it has the most parameters and the longest
 * values. The expected fields therefore come in as an argument, taken from
 * each tool's own `inputSchema.required`, so a new tool is covered without
 * anyone remembering to add it.
 *
 * The narrowness is the load-bearing part: a false positive here would mask a
 * genuine validation error, which is worse than the generic message.
