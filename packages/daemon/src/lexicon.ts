/**
 * Cue lexicons for the stop-lane heuristics (#476) — data, not code.
 *
 * The frustration and decision cue lists used to be `const` arrays baked into
 * stop-lane.ts: adding a term — or a language — meant editing source and
 * cutting a release. They live here now as SHIPPED DEFAULTS plus an optional,
 * user-editable runtime file per lexicon. The defaults are always the floor;
 * the file EXTENDS them (it never has to restate a built-in). A missing or
 * malformed file falls back to defaults, so the Stop hook is never broken by
 * it. Every read hits the file fresh (see loadCues), so an edit takes effect on
 * the next Stop event with no daemon restart and no rebuild.
 *
 * File format: one cue per line, `#` starts a comment, blank lines ignored.
 * A cue is a regex fragment in the same dialect as the defaults; stop-lane.ts
 * wraps it with the Unicode letter-boundary lookarounds. This is the
 * write-target a future automatic harvester would populate — but the floor is
 * just: stop baking the lexicon into the binary.
 *
 * Location: $BASTRA_LEXICON_DIR, else ~/.bastra/lexicon/<name>.txt.
