 *   does — name it; the bare form keeps the STOP.
 * - `stop`: no local undo (DROP TABLE, kubectl delete, gh repo delete, …).

 * Invariant for every undo: it changes HOW the act runs, never WHAT the caller
 * observes afterwards — the same end state, or a refusal the next step cannot
 * miss (`--force-with-lease`, `branch -d`), never a silently different one.
 * That is why `git clean` is not offered `git stash -u`: it also reverts
