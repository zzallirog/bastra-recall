/**
 * Shared transport for the thin hook clients (#343/#344/#15).
 *
 * Every migrated hook CLI is the same ~100 lines: read stdin, POST the
 * payload to its daemon lane, write the response body to stdout VERBATIM,
 * fail open to `{}` on every path. This module is that block, once.
 *
 * Deliberately dependency-free beyond node stdlib + env.js — a thin client's
 * entire value is its process-start cost (#305), and this module is part of
 * what #344 compiles into the stub.
 *
 * NOT used by prompt-hook.ts / hook.ts yet: those two landed before this
 * module existed and are committed + tested as-is. Folding them onto this
 * helper is a follow-up cleanup, not worth churning a shipped client for.
