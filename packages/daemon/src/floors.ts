/**
 * Floor registry (#141/#142) — the pin-with-lifecycle primitive, daemon-side.
 *
 * Recall is pull-by-relevance; some memories must be push-by-state: present
 * regardless of what the current turn thinks it needs (a killed option, a hard
 * constraint). The engine ships the MECHANISM only — a small registry of
 * floored memory ids the session hook injects above the relevance gate. The
 * CURATION (what gets floored, when a condition ends) lives in a governance
 * surface above the engine, never here.
 *
 * Deliberately a daemon-side state file, NOT frontmatter: the engine score and
 * the vault files stay untouched, so the survival-by-id invariant (see
 * docs/survival.md) holds by construction — release drops a memory back to
 * ordinary ranked retrieval, it never deletes anything.
 *
 * Entry shape (issue #142): an opaque per-entry handle, not a bare set.
 *   - `condition` is an opaque, surface-stamped token. The engine keys exactly
 *     two things off it — release-by-token and the audit line — and never
 *     learns what the condition MEANS.
 *   - `last_affirmed` is engine-stamped on affirm and exposed in the preload
 *     audit line; retire policy (when a stale floor falls out) stays in the
 *     surface. Anti-incidental-touch invariant: no `why` = no affirm = the
 *     clock does not move.
 *
 * Persistence: ~/.bastra/floors.json (override: BASTRA_FLOORS_PATH — same
 * per-file pattern as pending-suggestions.ts), atomic tmp+rename writes.
 * Latency is sacred: the whole registry is ONE small file read per session
 * start; the recall hot path (search.ts) is not involved at all.
