/**
 * The canonical list of MCP tool definitions the daemon exposes — the single
 * source of truth for both the embedded server (index.ts), the stdio forwarder
 * (mcp-forwarder.ts), and the `GET /tools` endpoint (http.ts).
 *
 * Why one place: the forwarder used to ship its OWN static copy of this list,
 * so the schema a client saw came from the forwarder's build while validation
 * happened at the daemon. A long-lived shared daemon running older code in RAM
 * (it deliberately doesn't restart on a dist rebuild — the update-staged
 * pattern) could then validate against a schema that differed from what the
 * client was told — surfacing as "argument X arrives undefined" (#132). The
 * forwarder now fetches /tools from the daemon, so the schema the client sees
 * always matches the validator; this constant is the fallback when the daemon
 * isn't reachable yet.
