/**
 * Putting the package boundary back into the graph (#582).
 *
 * MEASURED, not assumed. On the 44 scenario graphs of the code-roi v3 sample
 * and on this repository's own graph, Graphify emits a node for every import
 * target it cannot place in the tree it analysed. Two shapes exist, and they
 * need different treatment:
 *
 *   {"id": "ref_bastra_recall_core",         "external": true, "source_file": ""}
 *   {"id": "ref_bastra_recall_core_scope",   "external": true, "source_file": ""}
 *       A BARE SPECIFIER: `@bastra-recall/core`, `@bastra-recall/core/scope`.
 *       The id is the specifier with every non-alphanumeric character turned
 *       into `_`, prefixed `ref_`. No symbol granularity at all — the edge
 *       says "this file imports that module", nothing more.
 *
 *   {"id": "packages_core_dist_index_savememory", "external": true, "source_file": ""}
 *   {"id": "packages_core_src_save_savememoryinput", ...}
 *       A RESOLVED PATH plus a lowercased SYMBOL name. Graphify did resolve
 *       the specifier (here through core's `main: ./dist/index.js`), but the
 *       target file is a build artifact or otherwise outside the analysed
 *       set, so the node carries no source file.
 *
 * Both are dropped by `validate.ts`, and they carry between a quarter and a
 * third of all import edges in this repository (3260 of 21442). Every
 * core→daemon relation lived in there, which is why the file-level diagnosis
 * missed six of its eight cases in `packages/core`.
 *
 * NOTHING IS INVENTED HERE. A path-shaped id is only accepted when both its
 * directory prefix and its trailing symbol name exist in the graph, and the
 * symbol must live under that directory. A bare specifier is only accepted
 * when a workspace package.json claims that exact name and its entry file
 * exists on disk (`workspace-packages.ts`). Anything else stays dropped: a
 * guessed edge is a blast radius over code the change never touched.
