/**
 * Recall's own cross-platform build lock per repository (#581).
 *
 * WHY NOT GRAPHIFY'S LOCK. Graphify serialises its own runs with an
 * `fcntl`-based lock. `fcntl.flock` is a POSIX call: on Windows the Python
 * module does not exist, and the code path around it degrades to a no-op. A
 * lock that silently does nothing on one of the platforms is not a lock we
 * can build "exactly one builds" on. It is also Graphify's internal business,
 * with no stability guarantee across its versions — the same reason the
 * reader never depends on Graphify's `manifest.json` (see manifest.ts).
 *
 * WHY NOT `flock`/`fcntl` OF OUR OWN. An advisory lock's release is tied to a
 * file descriptor and a process. That is convenient when the process dies —
 * and useless for the two cases that actually occur here: telling a caller
 * WHO holds the lock, and taking over a lock left by a daemon that was
 * SIGKILLed while its file descriptor's owner was, for a while, still alive
 * in the eyes of the kernel. A plain file carrying pid, host and a timestamp
 * answers both, works identically on macOS, Linux and Windows, and is the
 * same shape `path-lock.ts` already uses for settings and the import stores.
 *
 * THE THREE WAYS A LOCK GOES WRONG, and what is done about each:
 *
 *   1. The holder died. Detected two ways, on purpose: a heartbeat that
 *      stopped ({@link LOCK_STALE_MS}), and — only for a lock written on
 *      THIS host — `process.kill(pid, 0)` reporting the pid as gone. The pid
 *      check is fast and exact but meaningless across machines (the same pid
 *      exists on a colleague's laptop sharing a network checkout), so the
 *      heartbeat is what makes takeover correct there.
 *
 *   2. The holder is alive and slow. A full build is ~11 s on this repo, an
 *      incremental one ~2 s. The heartbeat renews every
 *      {@link LOCK_RENEW_MS}, so a lock only looks stale after several
 *      missed beats — a build that takes a minute is never stolen from.
 *
 *   3. Two daemons race for the same lock. THE LOCK FILE IS NEVER DELETED,
 *      and every change to it has to win a turn first (#582 counter-review 4).
 *
 *      WHY NOT "CHECK THE TOKEN, THEN REMOVE THE PATH", which is what taking
 *      over a stale lock did before: those are two steps. Four contenders
 *      reading the same stale record all passed the token check; the first
 *      removed the file and published its successor, and a loser whose read
 *      had landed a moment earlier removed THAT one and published its own.
 *      Both then believed they held the repository — 386 double holdings in
 *      875 acquisitions, measured. No ordering of a check and a delete fixes
 *      it, because POSIX has no compare-and-delete to build one on.
 *
 *      SO THE LOCK IS A CHAIN OF GENERATIONS. Every record carries `gen`, and
 *      writing generation N means first creating the directory `N` under
 *      `<lock>.gens` — `mkdir` is atomic and fails with EEXIST, so exactly one
 *      process in the world may ever write generation N. A contender numbers
 *      its generation one past the record it read, so two contenders reading
 *      the same record compete for the same marker and exactly one wins; the
 *      loser reads again and finds the successor. The record itself is then
 *      `rename`d into place, which is atomic and leaves no window where the
 *      path is missing or empty. Releasing is the same move: it publishes a
 *      `free` record as the next generation, so a holder that was taken over
 *      loses the `mkdir` and its release does nothing — which is right,
 *      because it has nothing left to release.
 *
 *      TWO CASES HAVE NO PREDECESSOR TO NUMBER FROM, and each has its own
 *      atomic step. A lock path that does not exist is published with
 *      `link()`, which creates the name and the record in ONE step and fails
 *      with EEXIST for everyone else — numbering cannot settle it, because
 *      two contenders reading an empty directory would pick generations of
 *      their own and both succeed. A lock file nobody can PARSE (an older
 *      format, an interrupted write from before this scheme) is replaced by
 *      whoever wins a marker named after those very bytes, so contenders
 *      seeing the same junk compete for the same turn, and different bytes
 *      are a different turn — this can never wedge a repository for good. It
 *      is only done once the file is older than {@link UNREADABLE_GRACE_MS},
 *      because "cannot be parsed yet" is also what a competitor mid-publish
 *      looked like before `link` and `rename` closed that window.
 *
 *      The loser of any of these gets `null` rather than a queue position.
 *      That is deliberate — a refresh that cannot run now is re-enqueued by
 *      the coordinator, and a queue of builds waiting on each other would be
 *      strictly worse than one build and one follow-up.
 *
 * A STOLEN LOCK IS STOLEN SAFELY, and "safely" means the former holder can
 * neither write to nor free its successor's lock (#582 counter-review 3 and 4).
 *
 *   RENEW writes through the holder's OWN DESCRIPTOR, never through the lock
 *   path. A takeover renames its own file over the name, so the descriptor
 *   then refers to an inode no name points at any more: the heartbeat lands
 *   nowhere and the successor's lock is untouched. There is no window at all
 *   here, because the name is never used.
 *
 *   RELEASE claims the next generation and publishes a `free` record. A
 *   successor already owns that marker, so the replaced holder's release is a
 *   no-op. There is no token comparison and no unlink to race with.
 *
 * NOT covered: a checkout on a network share where O_EXCL is not atomic —
 * the same limit `path-lock.ts` documents, and the same judgement: a lease
 * with a quorum is not what a code-graph rebuild is worth.
