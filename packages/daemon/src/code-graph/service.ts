/**
 * The daemon-side code-awareness service: preload, startup reconciliation and
 * the file and git watchers (#581).
 *
 * The pieces existed after #574/#575/#581 but nothing started them. This is
 * the wiring, and it is deliberately one module so that "who starts the code
 * graph" has a single answer.
 *
 * WHY `fs.watch` AND NOT CHOKIDAR. The vault watcher uses chokidar, but that
 * dependency lives in `@bastra-recall/core`, not here, and adding a runtime
 * dependency to the daemon is a decision with a blast radius (package size,
 * audit surface) that this change has no mandate to take. `fs.watch` with
 * `recursive: true` covers macOS and Linux, which is this sub-release's entire
 * scope (C-094), and Node >= 22 is already required.
 *
 * The reliability gap that buys is affordable HERE, and only here, because the
 * watcher is not the only trigger: git events, the Stop hook and startup
 * reconciliation all enqueue the same refresh, and a missed event costs
 * freshness, never correctness — a graph that fell behind is marked stale by
 * the manifest and the Write/Edit block says so (C-092). The vault watcher has
 * no such backstop, which is why it needs chokidar and this does not.
 *
 * WHY THE WATCHER IS COARSE. It does not try to decide which files matter.
 * `extract --code-only` re-walks the tree anyway and costs ~2 s incrementally,
 * so a precise filter would spend more effort than it saves. What it does
 * filter is noise that would otherwise retrigger forever: the graph directory
 * itself (the build writes there — watching it would be a refresh loop) and
 * `.git`, `node_modules` and dot-directories.
