/**
 * One telemetry row per `find_code` / `find_affected_files` call (#589).
 *
 * WHY THIS WAS MISSING AND WHY IT MATTERS. The dependents block that the
 * Write/Edit lane injects has been counted since #579 (`log-stats-code.ts`),
 * but the two TOOLS an agent calls on purpose wrote nothing at all. So the one
 * question the feature exists to answer — does anyone call it, and does it
 * answer — had no number in either readout, and "code awareness is quiet"
 * could not be told from "code awareness is never asked".
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT IN THE ROW. Not the query, not the file, not the symbol names,
 * not the repository path: a query is what the user is working on, and the
 * shapes here are meant to be countable, not readable. `repo` is the last two
 * path segments, the same short form the agent-facing notes already print —
 * enough to tell two repositories apart, not enough to reconstruct a tree.
 *
 * Lives beside the tools rather than inside them: `find-code.ts` and
 * `find-affected-files.ts` answer the call, and both call sites (MCP and the
 * /api/v1 dispatcher) need the identical row.
