/**
 * The dependents block in the PreToolUse Write/Edit lane (#577, part of #572).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Before an agent edits a file it does not know what else in
 * the repository leans on it. The information is already in the graph
 * (#575); it just never reaches the moment where it would change a decision.
 * So the lane that already hands the agent the file's line count
 * (`file-size-check.ts`) also hands it the one-hop blast radius. Same lane,
 * same deterministic character, no new hook: #577 explicitly rules out hooks
 * on Read, Grep or Glob — Recall does not nag before a lookup, unlike
 * Graphify's `hook-guard`.
 *
 * WHY IT IS SILENT WHEN COLD. Measured in #575 on this repo's graph: a first
 * access costs read 5.89 ms + parse 15.24 ms + index 5.23 ms = 26.35 ms
 * (11.1 MB) or 20.72 ms (9.7 MB). The block's budget is ~10 ms on the warm
 * path, so a cold start does not fit and is not spent in the lane.
 * `CodeGraphCache.get()` therefore answers `null` immediately and loads in the
 * background, and this module returns `null` with it — no warning, no error,
 * no "graph is loading" line. A loading graph is a normal state, and a hint
 * that the agent cannot act on is pure context cost (§16.3). The next edit in
 * the same session has it. The warm lookup itself measured p50 0.003 ms /
 * p90 0.005 ms over 200 iterations, so the budget is not the lookup — it is
 * the two small IO calls the staleness check makes, and those run only after
 * the dedupe check has already decided the block will be emitted. Measured
 * end to end on this repo's real 10.2 MB graph, 200 iterations of the whole
 * function including the staleness IO: p50 0.044 ms, p90 0.101 ms, worst
 * (first, cold page cache) 6.40 ms — against a 10 ms ceiling that is checked
 * rather than assumed.
 *
 * WHY THE WORDING IS FLAT. The counter-review's standing objection to
 * Graphify's hook text is that it issues orders ("MANDATORY", "You MUST") for
 * something it merely knows. A dependency list is information; what to do with
 * it is the agent's call. Nothing here is phrased as an instruction, and a
 * code hop never marks a memory `required` (§13.1, §24) — this block is
 * separate text from `<recall-hints>` and carries no band.
 *
 * WHY IT DEDUPES LIKE A MEMORY HINT. §16.2: the same content repeated on every
 * edit of the same file is cost without a marginal chance of being acted on.
 * The block therefore rides the existing per-session file bus
 * (`session-state.ts`), under a namespaced key, so the size-check note and the
 * memory hints keep their own bookkeeping untouched. Token cost is booked
 * where the other deterministic notes are booked: the lane counts the finished
 * string into `hint_tokens_est` (§16.3).
 *
 * WHY THE REPO ROOT IS JUST THE LANE'S `cwd`. Resolving a checkout root from
 * an arbitrary path belongs to the git helpers built alongside this (#581);
 * duplicating a walk-up here would cost a stat chain on every single write in
 * every repository that has no graph at all. A repository without a graph is
 * answered from the cache's degraded state after the first miss, which is the
 * "no extra latency" acceptance of #577.
