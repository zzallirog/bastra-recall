/**
 * Building the code graph with the pinned Graphify binary (#574).
 *
 * THE COMMAND IS ALWAYS `graphify extract <repo> --code-only`. Never
 * `graphify update`. The pre-build counter-review measured both on this repo:
 *
 *   graphify extract . --code-only   6,677 nodes  19,444 edges  11.14 s
 *   graphify update .                7,671 nodes  20,603 edges   9.32 s
 *
 * `update` looks like the cheaper one and is the wrong one: it has no
 * `--code-only` flag, so it indexed 65 Markdown files as well. That breaks the
 * code-only boundary of C-089/C-090 and §23 — documents must not be pulled
 * into the code graph — and the speed difference is an artefact of comparing
 * two different workloads, not a saving. `assertNoForbiddenCommand` below
 * makes the rule testable rather than a comment nobody re-reads.
 *
 * `extract --code-only` IS INCREMENTAL, and that fact retired two earlier
 * decisions. Re-measured here:
 *
 *   unchanged tree     1.53 s / 2.11 s (800 files cached, 18 re-extracted)
 *   one changed file   2.18 s
 *   one deleted file   2.68 s — the deletion was picked up WITHOUT `--force`
 *
 * The old premise ("a refresh costs 9-12 s even for one file") was simply
 * wrong, and it was the premise behind both the 20 s debounce (#581 now uses a
 * few seconds) and the automatic `--force`.
 *
 * `--force` IS NEVER PASSED AUTOMATICALLY. Graphify refuses to replace a good
 * graph with a much smaller one; that refusal is a safety property — it is
 * what stops a half-checked-out tree or a failed extraction from wiping a
 * working graph — not an obstacle to route around. `--force` exists here only
 * behind `rebuild: true`, which one explicitly confirmed CLI repair uses.
 *
 * THE BINARY IS ALWAYS ABSOLUTE. `~/.bastra/tools/bin/graphify` (#573),
 * overridable with BASTRA_GRAPHIFY_BIN for tests and for a developer's own
 * checkout. Never a bare `graphify` on PATH: the daemon is started by launchd,
 * whose PATH is not the user's shell PATH, and a PATH lookup would also let an
 * unrelated binary of that name run against the user's repositories.
 *
 * TWO ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES, ALWAYS. `GRAPHIFY_QUERY_LOG_DISABLE=1` keeps
 * Graphify from writing a query log into the user's project, and
 * `PYTHONHASHSEED=0` makes its community detection reproducible — without it
 * two builds of an unchanged tree produce different community ids, which shows
 * up as spurious graph churn.
 *
 * FAILURE LEAVES THE PREVIOUS GRAPH ALONE. Nothing here deletes graph files.
 * A failed build writes `dirty: true` and `lastError` into Recall's manifest
 * and returns; recall keeps working on the last good graph with the staleness
 * marker (#577), which is strictly better than having no graph at all.
