/**
 * Git path resolution for the code graph (#574, #581).
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL. The original plan watched `<repo>/.git/HEAD`
 * and `<repo>/.git/refs` to notice a commit, a checkout or a pull. That is
 * wrong in exactly the setup the issues promise to support: in a LINKED
 * WORKTREE `<repo>/.git` is a FILE, not a directory — one line of
 * `gitdir: /path/to/main/.git/worktrees/<name>` — so every hard-coded
 * `<repo>/.git/...` path resolves to nothing, the watcher silently never
 * fires, and the graph of the worktree quietly rots. Nothing errors; the
 * feature just stops working, which is the worst failure shape available.
 *
 * Worse, the two paths do not even live in the same place. Measured on this
 * repo's own linked worktree (git 2.39):
 *
 *   --git-dir          .../main/.git/worktrees/wt-a      (worktree-private)
 *   --git-common-dir   .../main/.git                     (shared)
 *   --git-path HEAD    .../main/.git/worktrees/wt-a/HEAD (private — per worktree)
 *   --git-path refs    .../main/.git/refs                (shared — common dir)
 *
 * So a single "the git dir" does not exist, and joining `HEAD` and `refs`
 * onto the same base is wrong for one of them whichever base is picked. Git
 * answers the question itself, per path, and that is the only answer that
 * stays right across plain clones, linked worktrees, submodules, `GIT_DIR`
 * overrides and whatever git does next. So every path here goes through
 * `git rev-parse`, and no caller is given a way to guess one.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE THROWS. Not being in a git repo is a normal state (#574: the
 * manifest's `commit` is `null` outside one), git may be missing from PATH,
 * and a hung git on a network filesystem must not hang the daemon. Every call
 * is bounded by a timeout and reports failure as `null`, because a code graph
 * that cannot answer "which commit" is still a usable code graph.

 * budget rules out a process start) and caches hits and misses.

 * does not exist yet, or a tree with no repository marker at all. Returning
 * `cwd` there preserves exactly the previous behaviour instead of turning a
