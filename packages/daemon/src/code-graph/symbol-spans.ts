/**
 * Where a symbol ENDS — read off the source, because the graph does not say.
 *
 * Graphify gives every node one `source_location`, `L180`, and no end. The
 * change-impact query needs both: a diff line is only evidence about a symbol
 * if it falls INSIDE it. Attributing a line to "the last symbol that starts at
 * or before it" — the editor-breadcrumb heuristic `affected.ts` used before —
 * gets the gaps wrong, and the gaps are where the doc comments, the top-level
 * constants and the import block live. Measured on the v3 sample, two of the
 * five incomplete scenarios were exactly that: a changed line landed on the
 * wrong symbol, the selection came back non-empty, and a non-empty selection
 * is what suppresses the whole-file fallback that would have found the file.
 *
 * So the span is computed from the file itself, with a bracket balance for
 * anything brace-shaped and an indentation rule for what is not (a multi-line
 * type union, a Python `def`). Both are approximations. A span that is too
 * SHORT fails safe: the line stays unattributed, which the caller reads as
 * "fall back to the whole file". A span that is too LONG does not, and an
 * earlier version of this file claimed it did (#582 review). An over-long span
 * swallows a later top-level change, attributes it to the wrong symbol and
 * hands back a confident non-empty selection — precisely what suppresses the
 * fallback. So the long direction is guarded three times: the lexer handles the
 * construct that caused it (regex literals, including the `)` that decides
 * whether a slash is one), and whatever it still gets wrong surfaces as an
 * unbalanced file, as a top-level span overrunning its neighbour, or as a
 * top-level block whose own body steps back to column zero before its end —
 * and then the whole file is taken. Precision is the cheaper loss.

/**
 * The bracket balance of each line, with comments and string literals taken

 * counting it would move every span below it.
 *
 * Block comments and template literals carry their state across lines, which
 * is the whole reason this is one pass over the file rather than a per-line
 * regex.
 *
 * REGULAR EXPRESSION LITERALS ARE LEXED, because leaving them out was not the
 * safe approximation the earlier comment here claimed (#582 review). A `/{/`
 * inside a function opens a brace that never closes, so that function's span
 * runs to the end of the file, a LATER top-level change lands inside it, the
 * selection comes back non-empty — and a non-empty selection is exactly what
 * suppresses the whole-file fallback. The error direction is not symmetric:
 * that one loses a dependent silently.
 *
 * `/` is ambiguous between division and a regex, and the ambiguity is resolved
 * the way every JavaScript lexer resolves it: by what came BEFORE. After a
 * value — an identifier, a number, a string, `)`, `]`, `}` — it divides; after
 * an operator, a comma, an opening bracket or one of the keywords below, it
 * opens a regex. What is left over is caught by the balance check in
 * `symbolSpans`, which drops the whole file rather than trust a bad count.
 *
 * `)` IS TWO DIFFERENT TOKENS, and reading them as one was the same bug over
 * again (#582 counter-review): `a(b) / c` divides, `if (x) /{/.test(s)` does
 * not. So every open bracket is pushed on a stack that remembers whether its
 * `(` closed a CONTROL-FLOW head, and only that kind of `)` lets a regex
 * follow. Without it `if (x) /{/…` opened a brace that never closed, and the
 * miscount could be cancelled out by a later `/}/` — leaving a balanced file,
 * a span running past the end of its function, and a top-level change
 * attributed to it. That is the silent-loss direction, not the safe one.
 *
 * `}` IS TWO DIFFERENT TOKENS FOR THE SAME REASON (#582 counter-review 3). The
 * `}` that ends a BLOCK ends a statement, so the next `/` opens a regex; the
 * `}` that ends an OBJECT LITERAL is a value, so the next `/` divides. Treating
 * every `}` as a value left `if (x) {}` followed by `/{/…` reading that regex
 * as a division — and two such regexes, one carrying `{` and one carrying `}`,
 * cancel out: the file stays balanced, no guard fires, and the span before them
 * quietly swallows the top-level code that follows. So the stack remembers per
 * `{` which one it was, decided by the token in front of it: after `)`, `=>`,
 * `else`/`do`/`try`/`finally`, a `class`/`interface`/`enum`/`namespace` head,
 * or at the start of a statement it is a block; anywhere else — after `=`, `(`,
 * `,`, `:`, `[`, `return` — it is a value.

 * identifier sits directly after a statement boundary AND the enclosing
 * bracket is a block rather than an object literal — which is what keeps
 * `{ key: {} }` a property and `outer: {}` a label.
