/**
 * What a whole task changed, and which dependents it never opened (#572).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The Write/Edit lane answers one question per edit: "this
 * change has these dependents". It answers it well, and then it dedupes — the
 * same answer is deliberately not repeated within a session
 * (`impactDedupeKey`). Both properties are right for a lane that fires on
 * every call, and together they mean the SESSION-WIDE answer can never emerge
 * from it: after forty edits nobody has computed the union, and nobody has
 * subtracted the files the task went on to open.
 *
 * `find_affected_files` computes a union like it from git — and #606 measured
 * that agents do not call it: 0 of 44 in v3, zero real calls across a full day
 * of sessions. The answer exists and is never asked for. #606's own conclusion
 * was to stop persuading and deliver through Recall's lanes; this module
 * applies that conclusion one level up, at the task boundary instead of at the
 * single edit.
 *
 * WHY THE HITS ARE BOOKED AT EDIT TIME AND ONLY SUMMED HERE. The tempting
 * design asks the graph once, at Stop. It is wrong, and an adversarial review
 * of the first draft found why: the watcher reindexes after every edit
 * (`service.ts`), so the graph at Stop is the graph AFTER the task. A symbol
 * the task deleted is gone from it together with every edge that pointed at
 * it — exactly the dependents most certain to be broken. The only graph that
 * knows them is the one the Write/Edit lane holds the moment before the edit,
 * and that lane already computes the hits. So it books them
 * (`SessionState.touched`), and the boundary is a pure sum: recorded
 * dependents, minus the files the task wrote.
 *
 * WHY WIDER, NEVER NARROWER. Every fork here resolves the way
 * `pending-diff.ts` resolves it: an extra candidate costs the agent one file
 * it opens and closes, a missing dependent is a mistake it cannot see. So
 * nothing filters on "a body edit cannot break a caller" — a removed side
 * effect, a new throw and a changed invariant all live inside a body.
 *
 * WHY AN UNPLACED EDIT IS NOT SILENCE. The lane cannot always look: cold
 * graph, unreadable change, overrun budget, a fifth apply_patch target. Such a
 * file is asked about here against the CURRENT graph, whole-file. That answer
 * is late and says so (`basis: "whole_file_now"`); with no graph at all, or
 * for a deleted CODE file the reindexed graph has already dropped, the file is
 * returned in `unanswered`. It is never dropped — "I could not look"
 * and "nothing depends on it" must not render the same. A deleted file the
 * graph could never have indexed (a CHANGELOG.md) is the one exception: there
 * was no answer to lose, so claiming its dependents are unknown is noise.
 *
 * THE ONE DELIBERATE NARROWING, NAMED. A dependent the transcript proves was
 * read AFTER the change is moved from `missed` to `seen`, and a boundary with
 * only `seen` files renders nothing. A read is not a review — it may have been
 * partial — so this does trade recall for quiet. It is kept because what the
 * block asserts is "never opened since", and a later read falsifies exactly
 * that; the block never claimed "reviewed". `seen` stays in the result, so the
 * caller can show the count and the trade is reversible in one line.
