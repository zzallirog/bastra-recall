/**
 * The change-impact block the Write/Edit lane DELIVERS (#606, epic #572).
 *
 * WHY THIS REPLACES THE DEPENDENTS BLOCK. `dependents-block.ts` answered for
 * the whole FILE: every symbol in it, every importer of any of them. Measured
 * on the 44 scenarios of the code-roi v3 sample that is 87.4 % recall at
 * 43.5 % precision — more than half of what it names imports the file without
 * touching anything the edit changes. The symbol-level answer of `affected.ts`
 * is better on both axes (96.6 % / 47.4 %) and is what `find_affected_files`
 * has been serving since #582. The tool, though, is never called: v3 recorded
 * 0 calls in 44 of 44 runs, and a full day of real sessions on 19.09.2026
 * recorded 0 as well. Server instructions reach a session once, on connect;
 * tool descriptions are advisory. So the answer stops being OFFERED and starts
 * being DELIVERED, through the lane that already runs on every write.
 *
 * `dependentsNote` stays where it is on purpose: it is the file-level arm the
 * measurement compares against (`packages/eval/code-roi/measure-deps.mjs`), and
 * deleting the baseline to ship its replacement would leave nothing to measure
 * against.
 *
 * WHERE THE DIFF COMES FROM. The lane runs BEFORE the edit, so there is no git
 * diff yet — `pending-diff.ts` builds one out of the tool input instead. A
 * Write or an Edit becomes a real unified diff against the working tree and
 * goes through `diffSymbols` unchanged; an apply_patch document cannot be
 * placed in the tree without applying it, so its changed lines are read for
 * symbol NAMES alone. Whatever cannot be narrowed takes the whole file and
 * says so in `basis`, exactly as the tool does.
 *
 * WHY IT IS STILL SILENT WHEN COLD, AND STILL FLAT. Both rules from #577 hold
 * unchanged: `CodeGraphCache.get()` answers null and loads in the background,
 * and this returns null with it rather than announcing a loading graph; and
 * nothing here is phrased as an instruction, because a candidate list is
 * information and what to do with it is the agent's call.
 *
 * WHY THE DEDUPE KEY CARRIES THE SYMBOLS. #577 deduped per session and FILE:
 * the second edit of a file was silent, however different it was. Symbol-level
 * answers are not interchangeable that way — editing `saveMemory` and then
 * `validateMemory` in the same file are two different blast radii, and
 * suppressing the second one hides the answer precisely when it changed. So
 * the key is the file, the symbol set AND the graph's generation: a rebuilt
 * graph may have a different answer for the same symbols, and #606 asks for
 * that one to be delivered again.
