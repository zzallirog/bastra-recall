/**
 * `find_code` — the one code-awareness tool an agent calls (#576).
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT A SEARCH ENGINE. Graphify ships its own free-text `query`,
 * and the 17.09.2026 evaluation (#572) measured what it returns: 684 nodes for
 * one narrow question. A near-miss presented as an answer costs more than no
 * answer at all (§4.4 `no_answer`), so that lane is not used here. What is
 * used is the part of the graph that is not a guess — the exact lane of
 * §9.2-9.3: a symbol name resolves to the node with that label, a repo-
 * relative path resolves to the file with that path. Only when both come back
 * empty does a lexical fallback run over symbol labels and paths, and it says
 * so (`lane: "lexical"`), so the agent can see it is looking at a substring
 * match rather than an identity.
 *
 * WHY THE OUTPUT IS THIS SMALL. The tool answers "where is it and what
 * touches it", never "what does it say". It emits `symbol, kind, file:line`
 * and at most ONE hop of dependents (the hard hop budget of
 * §13.1) — no code bodies, no file contents. The agent follows `file:line`
 * with a targeted read, which costs it one Read of the lines it actually
 * needs instead of a graph-shaped wall of text in every turn.
 *
 * MEASURED on this repository's real graph (6810 nodes, 20005 edges, 9.7 MB),
 * warm, 200 iterations per lane, three runs (17.09.2026):
 *
 *   find_code("saveMemory")                  p50 0.013 ms   p90 0.019-0.022 ms
 *   find_code("packages/core/src/save.ts",
 *             mode: "affected")              p50 0.006 ms   p90 0.009 ms
 *   lexical fallback, hit ("audit-sav")      p50 0.35 ms    p90 0.41-0.48 ms
 *   lexical fallback, miss ("savememoryxy")  p50 0.46 ms    p90 0.57-0.62 ms
 *
 * against the 50 ms warm acceptance of #576 — three orders of magnitude of
 * headroom. The lexical lane is the slow one because it is the only lane that
 * scans (one pass over 6810 nodes) and its MISS is the slowest case of all,
 * since a miss is the one that cannot stop early. That is also why it stays
 * the fallback and not the default.
 *
 * COLD IS NOT AN ERROR. `CodeGraphCache.get()` returns null for a repository
 * whose graph is not in memory and starts the load in the background; a cold
 * load costs 20-26 ms and this call never waits for it. The answer is then
 * `status: "unavailable"` with the honest reason, not an empty hit list — an
 * empty list would read as "this symbol does not exist" (#575, §4.4).
 *
 * LABELS CARRY THEIR PARENTHESES. Graphify writes a callable's label as
 * `saveMemory()`, not `saveMemory`, and an agent types the bare name. The
 * reader indexes both spellings (`bareLabel`), so the exact lane here matches
 * the query verbatim and the acceptance case of #576 resolves on the name an
 * agent would actually send.
