/**
 * `find_affected_files` — the change-impact question, asked of the graph
 * first (#582).
 *
 * WHY A SECOND TOOL AND NOT A MODE OF `find_code`. The v3 measurement
 * (`packages/eval/code-roi/v2/BEFUND.md`) recorded the finding that matters
 * here: in 44 of 44 runs the agent was offered `find_code`, and in 44 of 44
 * it used grep instead. `find_code` is named and described as a LOCATOR — "a
 * symbol or file in the indexed code graph" — and an agent asking "what
 * breaks if I change this?" does not read that as its tool. A mode flag on a
 * locator is found by an agent that already decided to call the locator,
 * which is exactly the agent that does not exist here.
 *
 * So this is its own tool, named after the question, and its description says
 * when to reach for it rather than what it indexes.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES DIFFERENTLY. `find_code(mode: "affected")` answers for a whole
 * FILE: every symbol in it, every importer of any of them. Measured against
 * the type errors the real historical changes produced, that is 87.4 % recall
 * at 43.5 % precision. This tool narrows to the symbols the DIFF touches
 * first, and crosses the workspace package boundary the graph itself does not
 * carry (`external-refs.ts`): 96.6 % recall at 47.4 % precision on the same
 * sample. `find_code` is unchanged and stays the locator.
 *
 * CANDIDATES, NOT PROOF, and the answer says so. Extracted import and call
 * edges carry no types: nothing here knows whether a caller passes the
 * argument that changed, and a caller reached through reflection or a
 * string-keyed table has no edge at all. The note tells the agent to grep the
 * symbol names before it acts.
