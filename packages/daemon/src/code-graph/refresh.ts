/**
 * The refresh coordinator: one build at a time per repository (#581).
 *
 * Four things trigger a refresh — the file watcher, a git event (commit,
 * checkout, merge, pull), the end of a turn via the Stop hook, and startup
 * reconciliation. All four run the SAME command (`graphify extract <repo>
 * --code-only`, see build.ts) and all four go through this one queue. They
 * differ only in what they mean when something is already running.
 *
 * THE STOP HOOK NEVER WAITS. {@link CodeGraphRefresher.enqueue} is
 * deliberately `void`, not `Promise<void>`: there is no way for a caller to
 * await a build even by accident. The Stop hook's own latency budget is
 * measured in tens of milliseconds and a build is measured in seconds, so a
 * build awaited inside the hook is a user-visible regression at the end of
 * every single turn. The queue is the contract; the hook only pushes into it.
 *
 * SINGLE FLIGHT, AND EXACTLY ONE FOLLOW-UP. Two edits landing during a
 * running build do not schedule two builds. They set one `pending` flag, and
 * one build runs after the current one. The flag is a boolean and not a
 * counter on purpose: `extract` is incremental and reads the tree as it finds
 * it, so a third build would re-read a tree the second one already covered.
 *
 * THE DEBOUNCE IS SECONDS, NOT TENS OF SECONDS. The original 20 s came from
 * the belief that any refresh costs 9-12 s. Re-measured, an incremental run is
 * 1.5-2.2 s (build.ts), so a short quiet period is enough to coalesce a burst
 * of saves while still meeting #581's "within 30 s" acceptance with room to
 * spare. Git events skip the wait: a branch switch is one discrete event, not
 * a burst, and waiting after it only widens the window in which the graph
 * describes the branch the user just left.
 *
 * RESTART RECOVERY IS THE POINT OF {@link CodeGraphRefresher.reconcile}.
 * Everything above lives in memory and a daemon restart loses it — that is the
 * gap the counter-review named, and the reason `dirty` is a field in an
 * on-disk manifest rather than a variable. On start, each enabled repo is
 * checked against its manifest: no manifest, `dirty` still set (a build was
 * killed mid-flight), or a file newer than `builtAt` → exactly one refresh is
 * enqueued. A stale lock from the killed daemon is taken over by lock.ts, not
 * waited on.
 *
 * REPEATED FAILURES STOP. After {@link DEFAULT_MAX_FAILURES} consecutive
 * failures a repository is given up on, with the reason kept for `bastra
 * doctor`. Retrying a broken Graphify install every few seconds forever would
 * spend the user's CPU to produce the same error; recall meanwhile keeps
 * working on the last good graph with the staleness marker (#577). An explicit
 * `manual` request always clears that state — the user asking again is the one
 * signal that something may have changed.
 *
 * A BUSY LOCK IS NOT A FAILURE. `locked` means another process — a second
 * daemon, or `bastra code index` in a terminal — is building this very repo.
 * That is the system working. It schedules one retry and does not count
 * towards the backoff.
