 * Which repositories have code awareness turned on (#574).

 * Recall builds a code graph ONLY for repositories the user enabled, never for
 * every directory it happens to see. A graph costs ~11 s to build, ~10 MB on
 * disk and ~20 MB of heap per repository, so "index whatever is open" is not a
 * defensible default — and it would also mean Recall writing into checkouts
 * nobody asked it to touch.
 *
 * The list lives in the global `~/.bastra/cli-settings.json`, not in a file
 * inside the repository. A config file in the repo would be an artifact that
 * shows up in other people's checkouts and can be committed by accident;
 * enabling is a decision of this machine, not of the project.
 *
 * Kept out of `settings.ts` on purpose: that file is already past the 800-line
 * ceiling the size convention sets, and this is a coherent responsibility of
 * its own rather than another entry in a grab bag. `settings.ts` keeps the
 * `code` field in `CliSettings`, because that is where the schema lives.
