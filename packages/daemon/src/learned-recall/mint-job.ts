/**
 * #353: Teacher 1 — the free in-band mint — on its own trigger.
 *
 * `bastra bridges mint` reads acted-on reaches from the telemetry log and
 * mints bridges; no model, no reranker, always runnable. It was CLI-only and
 * never invoked anywhere, so the pool froze while reaches piled up (zzalli
 * counted 111 unread reaches against a pool of 2). This module is the shared
 * core for both triggers: the CLI subcommand and the daemon's own schedule.
 *
 * Every run — minted or not — records itself twice (#353 observability):
 * a `bridges_mint` telemetry event, and <bridgesRoot>/last-mint.json with
 * host + trigger, so a frozen pool is visible without counting files.
