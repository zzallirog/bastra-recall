/**
 * Shared learned-recall bridges (#120) — the data model + pool + query expansion.
 *
 * A BRIDGE is a language-tagged vocabulary-expansion rule, NOT a memory. It says:
 * "in language L, a query phrased with `trigger_terms` should also search for
 * `expansion_terms`." That is the whole privacy contract — a bridge carries only
 * term lists and a language, never a memory id, body, or any vault content. It is
 * the lexical floor of zzallirog's "drag far next to near" idea: instead of an
 * encoder learning the far↔near map, a bridge widens the BM25 surface so a
 * far-worded query reaches the memory the contributor already proved it resolves to.
 *
 * #707: the language is a filing folder, not a gate. Bridges are stored under
 * bridges/<lang>/ (detected language, or "und" when detection abstains), and a
 * query without a configured language override consults every folder: the
 * trigger rule (two shared trigger terms) is the match, and trigger terms are
 * words of the language they were minted from. Before, only de/en queries could
 * mint or fire at all. Bridges are loaded read-only from a git-synced clone
 * (mirroring Bastra Commons) and never written there by the daemon.
 *
 * The shared/contribution path is privacy-sensitive: scrubBridge() is a best-effort
 * filter, and the real guarantee is the same PR review gate Commons uses. The local
 * pool (this machine only) and the contribution path are independent — toggle off
 * means neither runs.
 *
 * Wiring status (#120, staged): BridgePool.load + expandQuery are wired into recall.
 * mintBridge (harvest a bridge from a successful recall) and scrubBridge (contribute)
 * are implemented and tested but NOT yet wired into the live telemetry/contribution
 * loop — that step depends on #121 (the below-floor far slice is not logged yet). So
 * with the layer enabled but no cloned bridges repo, the pool is empty and the layer
 * is a deliberate no-op.
