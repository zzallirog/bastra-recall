/**
 * Turns Claude Code delivers with role "user" although nobody typed them
 * (#639, #649, #703). One predicate for every reader of user turns — the Stop
 * lane (transcript heuristics, and through it the after-session harvest), the
 * prompt lane (recall on UserPromptSubmit) and the bridge harvest's query
 * origin — so the lists cannot drift apart again (F11).
 *
 * Only the START of the turn counts. An owner prompt that quotes one of these
 * tags mid-text, or in backticks, is still an owner prompt.
