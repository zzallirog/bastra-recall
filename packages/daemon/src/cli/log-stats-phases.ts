/**
 * #305 — the two corrections that stand between this readout and a number a
 * release gate can be decided on. Both were found by hand-folding the same
 * JSONL the readout reads, and both move the answer by more than a factor of
 * two, in opposite directions per lane.
 *
 * **1. One call, two rows.** The thin clients (`-thin`) and the compiled stub
 * (`-stub`) write their own telemetry row when their socket budget expires —
 * by design, because "the daemon cannot log the calls that never reached it".
 * But a client-side *timeout* is not such a call: the daemon did receive it,
 * did finish it, and did log it. Both rows then land in the same series and
 * the lane is counted twice — once as the call it was, once as a failure.
 * Measured on the reference host, 73 of 74 client rows in the prompt lane had
 * a daemon row for the same call within 500ms; the `daemon-unreachable` rows,
 * which describe calls the daemon really never saw, had 1 of 38.
 *
 * **2. The client does not know the lane.** A client row has no trigger
 * classification — it never got an answer — and used to write the literal
 * `detected_mode: "none"`. Every client-side prompt failure therefore landed
 * in the silent lane, which is how the readout came to show `none` timing out
 * at 15% behind a 69ms median: an impossible shape, and the assertion lane's
 * failures wearing another lane's name. Since #545 both clients write
 * `unknown` instead — a row the fold still pairs with its daemon row when
 * there is one, and which the prompt-total reliability lane judges when there
 * is not.
 *
 * The fold fixes both at once: pair each client row with the nearest unused
 * daemon row of the same kind, keep ONE call with the daemon's lane and
 * latency, and let the client's verdict win — because whatever the daemon
 * managed afterwards, the turn got nothing.
 *
 * **3. Nearness is not identity (#305).** The first version paired on kind and
 * time alone, and two hook calls 100ms apart are the normal case on a machine
 * that runs several sessions: a session-A daemon SUCCESS was folded with a
 * session-B client TIMEOUT and rewritten to that other session's verdict.
 * Measured on the reference host's seven-day log: 82 of 139 client rows were
 * folded, and every single one of them crossed a session — 31 of those
 * rewrote a call the daemon had actually delivered. That is exactly the fault
 * class #305 was opened for, one level down: not the wrong lane this time,
 * but the wrong CALL.
 *
 * There is no call id on these rows — none of the seven lanes stamps one that
 * both the client and the daemon would write — so `session_id` is the identity
 * we have, and every writer already stamps it from the client payload (#356).
 * A pair must now agree on it; the window only bounds how far apart the two
 * rows of one call may sit. A client row with no session is left as its own
 * call: unidentifiable is not the same as unmatched, and guessing is what this
 * paragraph is about.
