/**
 * The `code search ROI` section of `bastra stats` (#579).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AS A SECTION OF ITS OWN. The pre-registration asks for the
 * cost and the reach of code awareness to be visible next to real session
 * data, not derived after the fact from a benchmark. Until this landed, a
 * hook call that spent 300 tokens on a dependents block and one that spent
 * them on memory hints looked identical in the telemetry — `hint_tokens_est`
 * counts the whole injected document.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT CLAIM. It reports what the feature COST and what it
 * OFFERED: tokens spent, dependants named, how often the graph was behind.
 * It cannot report what it SAVED, because the daemon cannot see the searches
 * an agent did not run. The comparison against a no-graph control arm lives
 * in `packages/eval/code-roi/`; as of 2026-09-18 it holds no verdict for the
 * current code (#588). Treat this section as the cost ledger, not as the
 * verdict.
 *
 * The one USE signal it can see is `followed`: a block named a file, and a
 * later write in the same session targeted that file — the registered
 * secondary `dependents_block_followed_by_edit`. A follow-up edit is evidence
 * the list mattered, not proof the block caused it; the agent may have gone
 * there anyway.
 *
 * Split out of log-stats.ts, which is already at the file-size ceiling.
 */

/**
 * WHAT #589 ADDED. The block above is the PASSIVE half — what the Write/Edit
 * lane injected without being asked. The two tools an agent calls ON PURPOSE
 * (`find_code`, `find_affected_files`) wrote nothing at all until #589, so
 * "nobody calls code awareness" and "code awareness answers nothing" were the
 * same empty log, and the `unavailable` cases — off, not indexed, still
 * loading, refused — were indistinguishable from each other and from silence.
 * `code_tool_call` and `code_graph_refresh` are the active half.
