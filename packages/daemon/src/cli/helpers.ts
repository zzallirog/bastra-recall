This folder is your bastra-recall memory vault. Every memory your AI saves —

## What a memory looks like

\`\`\`markdown
---
id: css-input-focus-ring-stacking
title: "Don't stack focus styles on inputs"
type: lesson          # lesson | preference | user-preference | decision |
                      # project-fact | workflow | meta-working | reference
summary: "Stacking ring + outline + custom :focus causes double focus rings."
topic_path: [css, input, focus]
tags: [css, focus-ring, ui-bug]
scope: all-projects   # or a project name
recall_when:          # the situations this should resurface in —
  - creating new input component      # the highest-weighted field there is
  - writing input or form css
---

The rule, then why it exists, then when it applies.
\`\`\`

\`recall_when\` is what makes a memory findable later: describe the *situation*
("about to write a Tailwind grid"), not the topic ("CSS").

## Working with it

- You don't have to write these by hand — tell your AI, and it saves them.
- Anything you edit here is picked up within seconds; no re-index step.
- Subfolders are free-form. \`.bastra/\` holds derived state (search vectors,
  audit log, trash) — leave it alone, it rebuilds itself.
- Files without a \`type:\` field — like this README — are ignored by the index.

Created by \`bastra install\`. To use a different folder, re-run:
\`bastra install all --vault <path>\`

New here? \`bastra onboard\` is a five-minute interview that seeds this vault
with your actual preferences instead of leaving you a blank folder.
