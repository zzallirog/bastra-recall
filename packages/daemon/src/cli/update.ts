 *
 * Homebrew does not, and this is not a detail. `brew upgrade` builds a new keg

 *     from. Every later preflight would take the `manifest.root !== opts.root`
 *     branch and skip the check, silently, forever — while printing "no install
 *     manifest yet … (a baseline is written after this update)" on the first
 *     run, which for brew is never true.
 *
 * There is no version-independent anchor to fall back on either:
 * /opt/homebrew/opt/bastra-recall is a symlink whose target is a completely
 * different file set after every upgrade, so a baseline taken through it would
 * report every file as modified. A check that can only ever skip itself is
