/**
 * The release threshold for automatic hook delivery (#305).
 *
 * #305 asks for "an explicit release threshold the packed client has to meet".
 * Until now that existed as prose — a single 600ms budget in a comment, and a
 * 200ms target in an issue title — which is why the gate could be argued about
 * instead of read off. A threshold nothing measures against is not a threshold.
 *
 * So it lives here, per lane, as numbers the readout checks on every run:
 *
 *  · `budgetMs`        — the wall clock the lane actually enforces. Mirrors
 *                        hook-budgets.ts; if the two drift, the readout would
 *                        report headroom against a ceiling nobody enforces.
 *  · `p90TargetMs`     — where the lane is expected to sit. This is what became
 *                        of #305's "cut the ceiling to 200ms": a target for the
 *                        fast lanes, which hold it, instead of one number the
 *                        slowest lane was never going to meet.
 *  · `maxFailureRate`  — the share of calls allowed to time out or error. A
 *                        timed-out hook returns nothing and the turn continues
 *                        as if there had been nothing to say, so this is the
 *                        number the "misses the release bar" claim is about.
 *
 * The values are set from seven days of real use (2026-09-05 → 2026-09-12,
 * `~/.bastra/logs`, restart windows excluded, client rows folded), not chosen
 * to be comfortably passed:
 *
 *   | lane       |   n |   p90 | failure | threshold |
 *   |------------|-----|-------|---------|-----------|
 *   | pretooluse | 723 |  87ms |   0.1%  |  200ms/2% |
 *   | none       | 351 | 245ms |   0.9%  |  300ms/2% |
 *   | assertion  | 273 | 731ms |  23.4%  |  900ms/5% |
 *
 * The assertion lane is the one that fails today, and it fails on the failure
 * rate, not on latency — which is the whole finding of #305 restated as a
 * number: it was being cut off at 600ms while the daemon went on to finish the
 * call. At the 1000ms budget, the same week's calls reconstruct to 99.3–100%
 * delivered.
 *
 * Below MIN_CALLS_FOR_VERDICT a lane is reported NOT EVALUABLE — stated, not
 * withheld: a lane with three calls can show 33% and mean nothing, and a gate
 * that swings on n=3 is worse than no gate, but a lane that quietly leaves the
 * list is how five of the seven automatic lanes went unmeasured for a whole
 * release. Same rule and same word as #437's arms (`stats-arms.ts`).
 *
 * The three lanes above were the whole table until the counter-review pointed
 * out that plan, SessionStart, Bash pre/post and Stop could not turn the gate
 * red at all. RELEASE_THRESHOLDS below carries all of them now, with the
 * measurement each new threshold was read off.

/**
 * #305 — every automatic lane the product advertises, and the event kind it

 *
 * Until this map existed, `aggregate()` knew two kinds. Plan, SessionStart,
 * Bash pre/post and Stop fell into `otherKinds` — an orientation line at the
 * bottom of the readout — so the release gate could not turn red for five of
 * the seven lanes that fire on their own. A gate that structurally cannot fail
 * for most of what it gates is not a gate.
 *
 * #543 — where these rows come from, stated here because this is where the
 * gate reads them: every lane below is written from BOTH ends. The daemon logs
 * the calls it served; the hook client (compiled stub or node thin client)
 * logs the calls that never reached it, with the lane's own event kind
 * (`hook-client-telemetry.ts`). Both halves matter for the same reason: a
 * client that stays silent on a transport failure removes those calls from the
 * numerator AND the denominator, so the lane reports the delivery rate of the
 * calls that were delivered. Five of the twelve lane/client combinations were
 * silent until #543, and every one of them could report PASS while calls were
 * being lost. If a future lane joins this map without a client row, its number
 * here is the healthy subset of itself, not the lane.

/**
 * #545 — the prompt hook as ONE lane, across every trigger class.
 *
 * The prompt lane is the only hook registration whose rows split into several
 * gate lanes: the daemon stamps the trigger class it detected, and each class
 * carries its own latency threshold. A client that never reached the daemon
 * cannot stamp a class — it writes `unknown` — and `unknown` has no threshold,
 * so those rows were rendered as an unjudged orientation line and the gate
 * stepped over them. Reproduced: six kind-based lanes at 40 healthy calls each
 * plus 40 prompt rows with `status: daemon-unreachable` and
 * `detected_mode: unknown` rendered every visible lane PASS and ended with
 * `gate: MET`, with the 40 lost calls in no verdict at all.
 *
 * The fix is not to file those rows under `none`. A failure whose class was
 * never determined is not a quiet prompt; booking it there would charge
 * assertion and retrieval losses to the silent lane — the exact fault #305
 * produced twice already (`2b7d285` wrote client Bash failures into the Write
 * lane, `ea95691` made client rows unfoldable). Both clients now say `unknown`
 * honestly, and this lane is what judges them.
 *
 * It is a RELIABILITY lane, not a latency lane:
 *
 *  · **No p90 target.** A p90 over a mix of a 4ms gated call, a 600ms quiet
 *    recall and a 1000ms assertion recall is a number about the week's prompt
 *    mix, not about the software; the class lanes below already hold latency
 *    against the budget each class actually enforces. `p90TargetMs: null`.
 *  · **Failure ceiling 5%, not 2%.** It counts the same calls as the class
 *    lanes, and the assertion class is deliberately allowed 5% (it pays a cold
 *    dense arm by construction). A 2% ceiling here would turn a window red
 *    that every class lane passes — a gate contradicting itself is a gate
 *    nobody can act on. 5% is the most permissive class ceiling, so this lane
 *    can only ever fail on losses no class lane was granted.
 *  · **Min-N 30**, the same number as every other lane (see
 *    MIN_CALLS_FOR_VERDICT). Below it the lane is NOT EVALUABLE, which does
 *    not pass the gate either.
 *
 * A row with `detected_mode: unknown` counts as a failure here even if it
 * carries no failure status: an unclassified prompt call is a call the lane
 * did not serve. That rule lives in `aggregate()`, where the rows are read.

 *
 * The rule used for the new five: take the fast-lane target (200ms) unless the
 * lane's tail says that would be a coin flip rather than a bar. Four of them
 * hold 200ms with room to spare — stop at a twentieth of its budget, bash-pre
 * and bash-post at half the target, plan far under it. Two get the
 * quiet-prompt 300ms instead: `session`, whose p90 sits at 142ms but whose max
 * is 569ms because SessionStart runs several queries at the one moment the
 * embedding arm is reliably cold; and `plan`, because 7 calls are not a
 * measurement to tighten anything on, so it inherits the target of the recall
 * lane it behaves like. Failure ceilings stay at 2%; only the assertion lane,
 * which pays a cold dense arm by construction, was granted 5%.
