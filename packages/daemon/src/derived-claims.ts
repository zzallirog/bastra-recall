/**
 * #467 — bounded, lazy facts for a memory.
 *
 * A derived claim stores a formula and the value stays in its source.  This is
 * intentionally narrower than a lifecycle engine: the resolver list is closed
 * and reads one regular file below the vault root.  Vault content reaches a
 * plain file read and stops there — no shell, no regex from content, no
 * network, no write path.
 *
 * #609 adds the verdict half: a claim that carries `expect` is compared with
 * what the source holds now, and the reader is told whether the note still
 * agrees with it.  The comparison is display-only, exactly like #235's anchor:
 * a difference is shown, and the reader decides.
