/**
 * #239 — normalized content similarity for the save-time advisories.
 *
 * `save_quality` used to gate its duplicate advisory on a raw BM25 score
 * (`hit.score >= 20`). BM25 is additive and query-dependent: repeating a term
 * multiplies it (`cors` 192 → `cors`×20 = 3849 on the reporter's vault), it
 * grows with corpus size and field boosts, and it has no stable meaning at any
 * absolute threshold. Field reports showed unrelated memories presented as
 * near-duplicates at five-digit "scores", pointing agents at the wrong
 * overwrite target.
 *
 * BM25 stays the cheap candidate generator. The decision is made here, on a
 * value that means the same thing on every vault:
 *
 *   similarity = Σ weight(t) for t ∈ A∩B  /  Σ weight(t) for t ∈ A∪B
 *
 * A weighted Jaccard over the authored high-signal fields. Symmetric, bounded
 * 0..1, and immune to term repetition because it works on SETS — the property
 * the raw score lacked.
 *
 * Token weights come from the field a token appears in (its strongest one).
 * `recall_when` outranks the rest because it is the field the author wrote
 * specifically to be matched; `summary` counts least because it is prose and
 * shares the most vocabulary with unrelated notes.
 *
 * Shared with #238 on purpose: that issue adds a "recall_when merely restates
 * summary" advisory, which needs the same primitive. Two competing similarity
 * measures inside one scoring function would be worse than either.
