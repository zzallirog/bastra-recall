/**
 * Append-only affirm log for the floor registry (#198).
 *
 * Why a log and not a field: `affirm()` used to stamp `last_affirmed = now()`
 * in place, which made a queued-then-replayed affirm indistinguishable from a
 * fresh one and let a stale replay drag the clock forward over newer state. It
 * also overwrote `affirmed_by` and `why`, destroying the re-justification the
 * dedup rule below treats as identity-bearing. One mutable field cannot carry
 * two clocks, and one row cannot carry a history.
 *
 * The two clocks:
 * - `occurred_at` — SURFACE-supplied intent time, carried engine-opaque. Only
 *   the queuing surface knows when the affirm was meant. The engine stores it
 *   verbatim, may test it for byte-equality (dedup), and must never compare it
 *   for ordering on the write path. Store, never reject: at the write gate a
 *   legitimate out-of-order drain and a stale replay are the same event, and
 *   only the read side — holding every act — can tell them apart.
 * - `recorded` — ENGINE-stamped write time. The one clock the engine owns,
 *   monotonic by construction because a replay is a physical write happening
 *   now.
 *
 * Omitting `occurred_at` is honest, not a gap: a surface that affirms inline
 * has no intent time distinct from the write. The field then stays absent
 * rather than being back-filled from `recorded`, so a reader can always tell a
 * carried intent time from an inline one. The projection orders such an act by
 * `recorded`.
 *
 * Retention is unbounded, deliberately. A cap would evict by insertion order
 * while live-intent is max-by-`occurred_at`; where those orders disagree — the
 * out-of-order drain this module exists for — eviction would drop the row
 * holding the newest intent and silently promote a superseded affirm back to
 * live. `MAX_FLOORS` rations the context window because the floor block is
 * injected; this log never is.
 *
 * Storage: `~/.bastra/floor-acts.jsonl`, beside the registry it anchors to and
 * on the same machine-global side — a floor is machine state, not vault state.
 * A separate file so unbounded growth never enlarges the blob `listFloors`
 * reads on every session start.
