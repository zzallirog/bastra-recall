/**
 * bastra-hook — the compiled thin-client stub (#344).
 *
 * One binary, every hook entry point as a subcommand: `bastra-hook prompt`
 * (UserPromptSubmit) and `bastra-hook write` (PreToolUse Write/Edit). New
 * lanes join as new subcommands and inherit the fast start for free — which
 * is what #369 did for `stop`, `session` and `todo`: those three were still
 * spawning a full node interpreter (~75-78ms measured, against ~25ms here)
 * because they had no daemon-side lane to POST to. Stop fires at the end of
 * EVERY answer, so it was paying that per turn.
 *
 * The statusline rides along the same way (#347 stage 2): `bastra-hook
 * statusline` lazily imports the built statusline bundle — not a lane, just
 * an entry point that inherits the compiled start.
 *
 * This is the deliberate difference to the rejected "compile everything"
 * path: the LOGIC lives in the daemon (#343) and stays hot-swappable with a
 * daemon restart; what gets compiled is the ~200 lines that must run in the
 * hook process — stdin → POST → stdout verbatim, the pure-stdlib skip gate,
 * the client-side telemetry for calls the daemon cannot see. A logic change
 * never needs a stub rebuild; only a change to THIS contract does.
 *
 * Why the start matters: the fast lanes are held to a 200ms p90 (#305 —
 * budgets are per lane now, see hook-budgets.ts). Measured on the reference
 * host, the node thin client pays 86–89ms of interpreter start before its
 * first syscall; the compiled stub pays ~15–25ms. That difference is the whole
 * point of #344.
 *
 * Built with `deno compile` (deno task in package.json — the toolchain that
 * is actually present on the dev host; bun would do equally). The stub uses
 * node:-specifier stdlib + a handful of dependency-free daemon modules only, so
 * both runtimes and plain node can run this file unchanged — which is also
 * the fallback: `node stub/bastra-hook.ts` behaves identically, just slower.

/** EVERY lane logs its own failure (#543). The three lanes added in #369 were

 *  kinds describe a pipeline that did not run, and a generic `hook_call` row

 *  now is not generic — each lane writes its OWN kind (hook-client-telemetry.ts),

/**
 * Per-lane wall-clock budget. Three lanes do not fit the 600ms recall budget:
 *
 *  · `stop` scans a transcript, and its node client has always used its own
 *    1000ms (BASTRA_STOP_HOOK_TIMEOUT_MS). Its answer is `{}` either way, so
 *    an early client timeout would only orphan work the daemon then finishes.
 *  · `session` mirrors what the fat session hook allowed itself: the lane
 *    budget plus 100ms, which is where its kill switch used to fire.
 *  · `prompt` (#305): its trigger class is decided daemon-side, after this
 *    POST, so the client cannot know whether it is serving the 600ms quiet
 *    path or the 1000ms assertion path. It must outlast the slowest one it can
 *    be handed — the daemon still cuts each class at its own budget, so the
 *    extra room is a backstop against a hung daemon, not added waiting. At
 *    600ms this client was cutting off assertion calls the daemon went on to
 *    finish: 73 of 74 client rows in the measured week had a daemon row for
 *    the very same call.
