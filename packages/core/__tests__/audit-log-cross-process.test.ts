/**
 * #365/3 — the audit ledger is cross-process, its read cache was per-instance.
 *
 * `AuditLog` kept `readAll()` in an instance field and only invalidated it in
 * its own `record()`. But `<vault>/.bastra/audit-log.ndjson` is written by the
 * daemon, the bridge and the CLI alike, so an instance never saw a foreign
 * append: `lastDeleteFor()` returned undefined for a delete that sits in the
 * file (and `auditedRestore` then threw `no delete audit-entry found`), and a
 * read of a not-yet-existing ledger cached `[]` for the life of the process —
 * the Mac-app audit view froze after its first call.
 *
 * The cache is now keyed on the file's `mtimeMs` + `size`, so a foreign append
 * invalidates it while an unchanged file still hits.
