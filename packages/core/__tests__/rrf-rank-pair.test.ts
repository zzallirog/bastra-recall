/**
 * Tests for the RRF rank pair exposed by `fuseRRF` (#230).
 *
 * The hybrid recall score is a RANK quantity, not a similarity: `fuseRRF` sums
 * `1/(RRF_K + rank)` across the BM25 and vector arms, and `recallHybrid` scales
 * the result by `RRF_SCALE` into a BM25-looking range. This test pins that the
 * fused entry carries the per-arm rank pair (1-based, null when an arm did not
 * return the hit) alongside the raw RRF value, so a caller can decompose any
 * score — and it pins the two structural anchors from the field report: rank 1
 * in both arms is the ceiling (≈163.934), rank 1 in one arm only is ≈81.967.
 *
 * Those two anchors are written against the SCALED score on purpose. `RRF_K`
 * moved from 60 to 5 to stop the damping constant from swamping the rank, and
 * `RRF_SCALE` is tied to it precisely so these numbers do not move with it: the
 * fusion reorders results, it does not re-denominate scores. A change that
 * shifts 163.934 or 81.967 is a change to every band downstream, and this test
 * is where it should fail first.
 *
 * Runner: node --import tsx --test packages/core/__tests__/rrf-rank-pair.test.ts
