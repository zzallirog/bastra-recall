/**
 * Trigger-Expander — doc2query-style write-time trigger expansion (#117).
 *
 * The far-recall problem: `recall_when` only fires when a query reuses its
 * words. A reworded query weeks later misses on the lexical layer. A query-time
 * cross-encoder would fix it but blows the 500 ms hook budget. So we move the
 * work to write time: a local LLM paraphrases title/summary/recall_when into
 * *different* words and we index those at a lower BM25 weight. The query path
 * stays byte-identical — the cost is paid once, offline, per memory.
 *
 * Pipeline (mirrors RelatedEnricher so the two compose on the same vault):
 *   EmbeddingIndex.onEmbed(id)
 *     → source unchanged (hash match)? → no-op   [breaks the reindex→embed loop]
 *     → else: chat() generates paraphrases
 *     → self-test filter (Doc2Query--): keep only paraphrases that retrieve
 *       their own memory — drops hallucinations, keeps the valuable far ones
 *       (the self-test is semantic, injected by the daemon as recallHybrid)
 *     → rewrite frontmatter (recall_when_expanded + _src), reindexFile
 *
 * Loop-prevention: the reindex re-embeds and re-fires onEmbed, but the source
 * hash now matches, so the second pass is a no-op. No file write, no loop.
 *
 * Concurrency with RelatedEnricher: both subscribe to onEmbed and rewrite the
 * SAME file. rewriteFile re-reads the file fresh immediately before writing and
 * mutates ONLY its own fields — so neither clobbers the other's (related_via vs
 * recall_when_expanded survive each other). The LLM gen takes ~1-3 s, well after
 * the in-memory related write lands, so the fresh read sees it.
