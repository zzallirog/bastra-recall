 * #230 / #249 — the "nothing really matched" signal, shared by every recall path.
 *
 * On the hybrid path the score is a RANK quantity, not a similarity: a list
 * always has a first element, so a nonsense query still produces a top hit at
 * 130+. `weak_result` is the flag that says the high score is rank-1-of-nothing
 * rather than a real match.
 *
 * It lived inside `recallHandler` and therefore only ever reached the MCP path.
 * `/hook/recall` — the path that writes `<recall-hints>` into an agent's context
 * on every Bash and Edit — never formed it, so the hint blocks labelled
 * everything above the threshold as "Strong matches" including pure noise. In a
 * live session that meant the same handful of unrelated memories surfaced at
 * 150-160 for every `rm -rf` and every file edit.
 *
 * Extracted here so both paths compute the same thing from the same code. A
 * second implementation would have drifted, and the two paths disagreeing about
 * what "weak" means is worse than neither having it.
 *
 * It sat in `packages/daemon` until the M1 tolerances (#262, §18.1) needed it:
 * `false_abstention` is to be measured as the share of answerable cases with
 * `weak_result`, and the gold-set runner in `packages/eval` cannot depend on
 * the daemon. core is the one workspace every path already depends on, so the
 * predicate moved here rather than being copied a third time — which is the
 * drift this docstring has been warning about since #249.

 *
 * The distinction comes from @zzallirog dogfooding, and it splits the miss in
 * two:
 *
 * - **rank-1-of-WRONG** — a legitimate both-arms pair on the wrong document.
 *   `recall("arch firewall")` returned a top hit at 158.89 built from rank 1
 *   in BM25 and rank 4 in vector; the fact existed, in memories whose triggers
 *   never carried a standalone `firewall` token. No score-only signal can catch
 *   that, because the hit is not rank-1-of-nothing. Client-side problem.
 * - **rank-1-of-NOTHING** — the top hit lives in ONE arm only. That is what
 *   this predicate detects, and it is the shape a genuinely absent fact takes.
 *
 * Why the rank pair and not "flat score distribution": on real data flatness
 * INVERTS. A genuine home spikes to the both-arms ceiling with its siblings
 * crowding just behind, so it shows a SMALLER top1→top2 gap than a miss does.
 * The rank pair is the honest signal; the gap is a trap.
 *
 * Kept separate from `weak_result` rather than folded into it: it is a
 * higher-confidence claim, and collapsing two confidence levels into one field
 * on the public contract would lose exactly the distinction that makes it
 * useful. Additive and back-compatible — `weak_result` is untouched.
