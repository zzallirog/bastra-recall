 * input) or to flag them at save time (save_quality advisory).
 *

 *
 * Why this exists: recalled context that gets quoted in a turn can otherwise
 * be re-captured as new memory content and re-indexed by doc2query — a
 * recursive pollution loop that skews trigger vocabulary and the heuristics'
 * file-token scans.
 *
 * Leaf module by design (like summary.ts): dependency-free, importable from
 * both core and daemon without creating import cycles.
