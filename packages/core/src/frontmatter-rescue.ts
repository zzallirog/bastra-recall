/**
 * #222 — field-level leniency for the vault loader.
 *
 * Reported by zzallirog: 28 editor-written notes dropped at daemon load, and
 * the only trace was a `console.warn` a launchd-started daemon never shows
 * anyone. README promises editing the vault in Obsidian or by hand, so a note
 * falling out of the index for one bad character is a broken promise, and a
 * silent one.
 *
 * The damage splits into two layers, and only the second is a schema problem:
 *
 *   A. The YAML never parses. Unknown escape sequences inside double-quoted
 *      values (`"it\'s"`) and unquoted scalars containing `:` or `·` throw out
 *      of gray-matter, so no `data` object is produced at all. This was 24 of
 *      the 28 files. `rescueFrontmatter` re-parses the block one TOP-LEVEL
 *      ENTRY at a time and keeps the ones that survive.
 *   B. The YAML parses but required keys are missing (4 of the 28).
 *      `repairRequired` fills them from what is knowable — the filename, the
 *      body, the file mtime — instead of rejecting the node.
 *
 * The line this does NOT cross: structural strictness. A file without
 * frontmatter, or without a recognizable `type:`, is still not a memory. And
 * nothing here is ever written back — the file on disk stays exactly as the
 * user wrote it. Repairs live in `Memory.damaged` so the vault report can show
 * them, which is the whole point: visible degradation instead of silent loss.
