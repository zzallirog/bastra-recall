 * of the event loop: it does not reject anything, it ends the process. That is
 * what killed the first tests/v2 mining pass after two and a half hours at 732
 * of roughly a thousand candidates — `write EPIPE`, the consumer having closed
 * the stdin the producer was still writing to. The remaining candidates were
 * never decided, and the population looked finished because the accepted count
 * had stopped moving anyway. Routed into the promise, the failure reaches the
 * per-candidate `catch` in the worker loop instead: one candidate is recorded
 * as not evaluable and the run carries on.
 *
 * Both children are killed on settle. A consumer that died leaves the producer
 * writing into nothing, and one leaked process per failed candidate across
 * four workers and a thousand candidates is not a leak anybody notices until
 * it matters.
