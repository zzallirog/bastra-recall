/**
 * Arm runner for the change-impact measurement, registration v4 (#582).
 *
 * v3 answered one question and raised another. It measured `find_code` offered
 * against no tool at all and found the agent never called it (0 of 44 runs), so
 * the comparison was two runs of the same grep behaviour. Two things were
 * confounded there and this runner separates them:
 *
 *   A          grep      no MCP server at all — text search and reads only
 *   B          offered   `find_code` + `find_affected_files` offered, nothing
 *                        else changed. Whether the agent CALLS them is the
 *                        observation.
 *   prefilled            arm A's setup — NO MCP server either — plus the
 *                        `find_affected_files` answer for the planned change
 *                        already in the prompt. It carries the answer, not the
 *                        tools: with the server attached as well, a gain could
 *                        not be told apart from arm B's (#582 review).
 *
 * The third arm is called `prefilled`, not `forced`: the information is
 * guaranteed to have been SHOWN, and nothing makes the agent use it. Whether
 * it does is part of what the arm measures, and a name that claims otherwise
 * would be read into the result.
 *
 * ADOPTION is read off B alone (tool calls per scenario). EFFECT is prefilled
 * against A. B against A measures the two together and is not the effect
 * question — reporting it as one is what made v3 unreadable.
 *
 * Everything else is v2's setup, deliberately unchanged: the scenario tree is
 * a `git archive` of the commit's parent (no `.git`, so no arm can read the
 * historical commit), the graph is built from that tree and moved out of it,
 * and every transcript is kept for re-scoring.
 *
 * FRESH SCENARIOS ARE REQUIRED. The 44 scenarios of v3 were used to develop
 * the query this runner measures; a number from them is a training number.
 * Mine a new sample into a new output directory first:
 *
 *   CODE_ROI_OUT=~/.bastra/eval/code-roi-v4 node mine.mjs --since <the v3 range_end>
 *   CODE_ROI_OUT=~/.bastra/eval/code-roi-v4 node evidence.mjs
 *   CODE_ROI_OUT=~/.bastra/eval/code-roi-v4 node select.mjs
 *   # adjudicate by hand, THEN register thresholds, THEN run this
 *
 * A COST CEILING IS ENFORCED, not documented: the registration caps the main
 * run, and every arm's cost is added up — the aborted ones too, from their own
 * `result` event where there is one and from an estimate where there is not.
 * The next arm only starts while the ceiling is still out of reach at the mean
 * cost of the arms that FINISHED; otherwise the run stops and says how far it
 * got. The accounting lives in `arm-cost.mjs`.
 *
 * A BUILD PREFLIGHT RUNS FIRST, every invocation (#582, Codex counter-review
 * 4): `dist/.build-revision` must name HEAD, the tracked build inputs must be
 * clean, and the four `arms.frozen_surface` hashes must match the
 * registration when recomputed from `dist` — a helping that fails any of
 * these stops before touching an arm. What passes is then pinned into
 * `build-pin.json` in the archive on the first helping and checked on every
 * later one; a mismatch aborts with the differing fields, never a silent
 * re-pin. See `build-pin.mjs`.
 *
 * Usage: npm run build && CODE_ROI_OUT=… node run-arms-v3.mjs [--only S01,S02] [--arms A,B,prefilled]
 *        CODE_ROI_OUT=… node run-arms-v3.mjs --preflight-only   (checks only, starts no arm)
