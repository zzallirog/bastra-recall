/**
 * Turn the miner's accepted candidates into the run's scenario file (#588).
 *
 * Assigns ids in mining order and the arm order per scenario from the
 * registered seed, BEFORE any arm runs. Adjudication happens on the written
 * file: a truth entry is removed only with a reason in `adjudication`, and a
 * whole scenario only with `excluded: "<reason>"` — both visible in the
 * archive, never silent.
 *
 * Refuses to overwrite a scenario file once any arm has run, so the selection
 * cannot be redone after looking at results.
 *
 * ARM NAMES ARE THE ONES THE RUNNER KNOWS. This wrote `control`/`treatment`
 * long after the runner moved to three arms A/B/prefilled, and `run-arms-v3`
 * skipped every unknown value in silence — a full sample would have produced
 * no run at all and no error (#582). The names now come from `ARM_IDS`, and
 * the runner refuses an unknown one loudly.
 *
 * WHICH REGISTRATION (#606). There are two now, with different arms, and the
 * one a sample belongs to is named on the command line (`--registration`) and
 * written into the scenario file, so every later step — runner, preflight,
 * scorer — reads it off the archive instead of assuming. The pilot exclusion
 * comes from THAT registration: #606's sample is mined from bastra-recall,
 * whose pilot commits are not the ones registration 6 names for bastra-io.
 *
 * Usage: CODE_ROI_OUT=<dir> node select.mjs [--registration <id>] [--arms A,B,prefilled]
