/**
 * The cross-package mechanism gate — offline, no agent, no money (#582, v6).
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. The main sample cannot answer the question #582 was built
 * for. Measured on its 40 scenarios: 53 truth files, of which TWO lie in a
 * different workspace package from the changed file. The package bridge can
 * therefore contribute at most (1 + 1/3)/40 = 3.3 percentage points of recall,
 * against a registered effect threshold of +5 — the mechanism cannot reach its
 * own gate even if it is perfect. The agent measurement stays as it is; this
 * gate asks the narrower question directly, on scenarios selected for it.
 *
 * WHAT IT MEASURES. For every scenario whose changed file lives inside a
 * workspace package and whose truth crosses a package boundary: the share of
 * those CROSS-PACKAGE truth files that `find_affected_files` names at depth 1.
 * Nothing else — not precision, not the intra-package half, not an agent's
 * behaviour. One number, one mechanism.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOT. It is not evidence that the tool helps anybody: no agent is
 * involved. It is the floor under the effect measurement — if the bridge does
 * not find these files offline, no description will make an agent find them.
 *
 * Usage: CODE_ROI_OUT=<gate archive> node mechanism-gate.mjs
