/**
 * What one rerank arm did, assembled into something a decision can be read off.
 *
 * Split from the runner because the two answer different questions and one of
 * them has to be inspectable without a vault: the runner talks to Ollama and a
 * 400 MB ONNX session, this file turns rankings into numbers and slices. Every
 * function here is pure.
 *
 * ── Three things this file exists to get right ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * **1. The score floor.** Production serves `slice(0, k)` and the consumer
 * drops everything under `BASTRA_RECALL_FLOOR` (30). Measuring rank on the
 * unfiltered pool would credit a reranker for promoting a candidate the user
 * never sees. So the order here is the production order — rerank the window,
 * cut to k, apply the floor, then measure — and the floor-free figure travels
 * beside it as an explicitly named UPPER BOUND, never as the headline.
 *
 * **2. Slices that are too small to read.** `mixed` is four cases. A bootstrap
 * interval over four paired deltas is arithmetic, not evidence. Any slice under
 * `MIN_SLICE_N` is reported as `not_evaluable` with its n, rather than as a
 * number somebody might quote.
 *
 * **3. One primary endpoint.** A full run produces several hundred confidence
 * intervals across arms, cuts and slices. At α=0.05 several of those are
 * "significant" under pure noise. Exactly one cell is marked `primary` and
 * carries the recommendation; the rest describe. `countIntervals` reports the
 * actual number rather than a figure written down once and left to go stale.
 *
 * **4. Splits that did not split.** A slice can be too small to read
 * (`MIN_SLICE_N`) or, worse, can look like a split while every case landed on
 * one side. `assignPoolBuckets` detects the second case and marks `by_pool`
 * unusable — see its comment for why the pool size is nearly constant here.

 * which looks like a result. The `above_pool_size` recommendation shape would
