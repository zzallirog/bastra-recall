/**
 * Generate the simulated-user queries `persona-lift.ts` consumes (#103).
 *
 * The three-arm survival number in #103 was measured on 2026-07-02 and cannot
 * be reproduced: the run kept its personas file locally, so the queries are
 * gone, and nothing in the repo could make new ones. That is the same defect
 * #338 fixed for the score bands — the instrument existed as a paragraph, so
 * re-asking the question meant re-arguing it. This is the instrument.
 *
 * WHAT THE MODEL IS ALLOWED TO SEE — this is the whole measurement:
 * title and summary only. Never `recall_when`, never the body. A persona that
 * has seen the trigger writes the trigger back, the overlap gate scores it as
 * `near`, and the harness measures its own prompt instead of query drift. The
 * far slice — the one #103 exists to move — would quietly empty out.
 *
 * Ecologically this is the honest framing anyway: weeks later an agent knows
 * roughly what a note was about and phrases the situation in its own words. It
 * does not remember the trigger its author wrote.

/** The voices. Kept deliberately far apart: a persona set that all phrases
