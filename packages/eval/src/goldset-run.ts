/**
 * The M0 baseline over the gold set (#262, §18.1).
 *
 * The stress harness in `packages/daemon/scripts/eval-stress.ts` measures the
 * repo fixtures — the very `PARAPHRASED_CASES` §19 rules out, because they are
 * paraphrases of the answer. Nothing consumed the gold set itself, so this is
 * the missing half: it takes the labelled cases and reports what retrieval does
 * on them.
 *
 * Every scoring rule is fixed by the label, not by this file:
 *
 *   - a hit is `expected_ids` in the ranking; `acceptable_alternatives` are
 *     scored separately, because §19 keeps the two apart on purpose;
 *   - how deep a hit still counts comes from the case's own
 *     `allowed_retrieval_depth`;
 *   - a `no_answer` case is correct when nothing clears the score floor;
 *   - a `probe_group` case is reported beside the set, never inside it.
 *
 * There is exactly one free constant here, `PRODUCTION_K`, and it is the k the
 * product actually uses. Widening it would change what damping and the re-sort
 * see, so the rank is measured at the production pool and nowhere else.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   BASTRA_VAULT_PATH=/path/to/vault npx tsx src/goldset-run.ts \
 *     --gold ~/.bastra/eval-goldset/gold-blind.json \
 *     --gold ~/.bastra/eval-goldset/gold-tel-1.json \
