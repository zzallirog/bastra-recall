/**
 * The mining run survives a broken pipe (#606).
 *
 * The first tests/v2 pass died after two and a half hours at 732 of roughly a
 * thousand candidates: `tar` closed the stdin `git archive` was still writing
 * to, the resulting `EPIPE` was an `error` event on a stream nobody listened
 * to, and node ended the process. A crash that looks like a finished run is
 * the worst shape this failure can take — the accepted count had plateaued, so
 * the population looked exhausted when it was merely abandoned.
 *
 * Both tests here are about that one line of difference. The first reproduces
 * the crash on the UNGUARDED pattern, in a child process, so the test proves
 * the failure mode is real rather than asserting a fix against nothing. The
 * second runs the same pipe through `pipeSpawn` and requires a rejection —
 * which the worker loop's per-candidate `catch` turns into "not evaluable".
 *
 * Run: npx tsx --test packages/eval/__tests__/code-roi-mine-pipe.test.ts
