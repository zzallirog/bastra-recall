 * number at all: `finalize()`'s `run.total || 1` turns 0 queries into a
 * clean "+0.0 pp" and exit 0, which reads as "no measurable lift" instead of
 * "nothing was measured" (e.g. a bad --cases/--vault pointed at nothing).
 * Revert-check: on unfixed marginal-lift.ts this test fails because the CLI
 * exits 0 and prints "+0.0 pp" instead of refusing to report.
