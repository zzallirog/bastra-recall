# bastra-recall v1.0 release gate — Codex review

Date: 2026-09-12  
Reviewed revision: `a4c0896f463edd8fb6560263be3432c6e37ceb53` (`main`, identical to `origin/main` at review start)  
Verdict: **NO-GO** until every P0 and P1 item below is closed and independently re-verified.

This is the handoff for Claude Code Max and the checklist for the final Codex counter-review. It records the release decision, not a request to repeat the discovery phase.

## Review-continuity incident — what actually interrupted the review

The user-visible interruptions were ChatGPT platform verification warnings triggered while raw defensive test payloads were being replayed in the review context. Automatic continuation then reintroduced the same payload vocabulary and made the interruption recur. Once verification completed and further security probing stopped, the non-security review continued normally.

A separate stale Codex goal flag also existed (`status: usageLimited` while account limits showed available capacity), but that was not the warning the user was seeing. The paused heartbeat must therefore not be described as having solved the platform warning.

Claude cannot change ChatGPT's platform verifier from this repository and must not attempt to evade it. The recall-side task is narrower: measure whether hooks, injected session blocks, pending suggestions, oversized recall payloads or retry wording unnecessarily duplicate raw fixture text and inflate the chance that the same review payload is replayed. Use context-tax telemetry and issues #354, #457, #462, #479, #484, #487 and #510 as evidence. Keep generated handoffs and fixtures neutral by using issue ids and semantic placeholders instead of copying raw payload strings. If recall materially amplified the replay, file/fix a measured issue; otherwise record the evidence-backed negative result in Claude's handoff.

## Executive release decision

The repository is in unusually good mechanical condition: type checks, all runnable tests, smoke tests, package validation, dependency audit, current CI, CodeQL and secret scanning are green. The package can be packed, installed from its tarballs, started with an isolated vault, and used for an immediate save/recall round trip.

It is nevertheless not ready for v1.0. Three P0 trust-boundary defects contradict the product's privacy/security promise, and 24 additional P1 release-contract, data-integrity or user-path failures remain open. These are not speculative backlog items; each is tied to an observed code path, a dynamic reproduction, an upstream status check, or a contradiction in the binding v1 contract.

The user stopped further security variant hunting on 2026-09-12. The three already-proven security findings remain release blockers. This report does not claim that every possible security variant beyond those findings was exhausted.

## What passed

- `npm run check:types`
- `npm test`: 2,488 tests; 2,486 passed, 0 failed, 1 skipped, 1 todo
- `npm run pack:check`
- `npm audit --audit-level=low`: 0 vulnerabilities across 268 dependencies
- `npm run smoke`: 7/7
- `npm run smoke:telemetry`
- `npm run test:update`: 11/11
- GitHub CI and CodeQL on the reviewed revision
- GitHub security inventory: 0 open CodeQL, Dependabot or secret-scanning alerts
- Coverage: 87.54% lines, 84.60% branches, 82.01% functions; the main core paths are predominantly 95–100%
- All five workspace tarballs packed and installed together in an empty temporary prefix
- Packaged CLI returned version `0.9.2` and complete help
- Packaged daemon contained its 50 skill/web assets; the wrapper remained executable
- Packaged `bastra install all --dry-run --vault <temp>` enumerated Claude Code, Codex/ChatGPT, Cursor and Claude Desktop with the expected hooks/skills
- Packaged daemon started against an isolated BM25 vault; REST save followed by immediate recall succeeded
- Release 0.9.2 carries all four native stub archives/checksums, the MCP bundle and installer scripts
- GitHub Actions use commit-SHA-pinned actions
- Packed tarballs showed no obvious secrets, personal files or temporary build debris
- A real isolated-home install registered Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Codex/ChatGPT and Cursor; `doctor all` validated every written adapter artifact; `uninstall all --yes` removed the registrations and shared skills while preserving user data. The requested Node-hook opt-out did not take effect and is tracked in #537
- Repeating the same real four-client install left all active config/skill hashes unchanged, created no additional backup and reported every surface already installed
- The packaged Map served its HTML and JavaScript, UI import staged candidates, the import hook returned the same count, UI onboarding saved profile memories and language settings, and `/vault/count` reconciled the result
- All 199 repository Markdown files were checked for local-link targets; after excluding intentional GitHub Wiki links and archived worktrees, the only broken local link is the one tracked in #523
- 195 installed dependency packages had declared permissive licenses; `npm outdated` found only routine patch/minor updates and no release-blocking dependency migration

## P0 — fix before any v1.0 release candidate

### #464 — private access is self-granted and hidden records are writable

Issue: <https://github.com/n0mad-ai/bastra-recall/issues/464>

Confirmed on the reviewed revision:

- A private memory returns `memory not found` through ordinary `load_memory`.
- The same external dispatch can pass `allow_private: true` and receive the full private body. `dispatchApi()` does not attach or verify a trusted Mac-app capability; the request body grants the privilege itself.
- Without reading the record, the same caller can use `save_memory(overwrite: true)` to replace its complete body. The `private` label survives, making the destructive change invisible afterward.
- `save_document(overwrite)`, `recategorize_document` and `move_document` have the same missing authorization boundary. Existing identity-safety tests currently prove that private sidecars can be changed by these handlers while checking only that their label survives.
- The earlier archive-only fix remains valid but did not complete the write-path audit required by the original issue.

Required design: establish a transport-bound trusted capability for the Mac app. No public MCP/REST argument may manufacture it. Apply the same decision to read, archive, overwrite, recategorize and move. Negative tests must prove that refused calls leave the original bytes and paths unchanged.

### #520 — a generic OpenAI key silently turns on cloud embeddings

Issue: <https://github.com/n0mad-ai/bastra-recall/issues/520>

`resolveEmbeddingChoice()` currently gives a generic `OPENAI_API_KEY` precedence as an implicit provider choice. A user who never opted recall into a cloud provider can therefore send recall queries, saved memories and the embedding backfill corpus to OpenAI, contradicting the local-only promise.

Required design: provider consent must be explicit. A generic key alone must remain BM25/local-only. Add a diagnostic/migration path for existing installations and negative egress tests. Rewrite the absolute privacy wording so it distinguishes vault-content egress from optional metadata/network features such as weather/geocoding, update checks and Commons sync.

### #526 — tokenless loopback exemption trusts the socket instead of the request

Issue: <https://github.com/n0mad-ai/bastra-recall/issues/526>

Packaged-daemon reproduction:

- `/health` with a foreign Host returned 403.
- `/api/v1/recall` with a foreign Origin returned 403.
- `/api/v1/recall` with a foreign Host and no Origin returned 200 without a token.
- `/api/v1/graph/node?id=...` under the same conditions returned 200 with the complete non-private body.

The API routes are excluded from the Host gate, then the token check is skipped solely because `remoteAddress` is loopback. DNS rebinding and local tunnels/reverse proxies inherit that exemption.

Required design: tokenless access requires both a loopback peer and a loopback Host. A foreign/public Host requires the correct token even when the proxy socket is loopback. Add same-origin/no-Origin DNS-rebinding and tunnel integration tests.

## P1 — required for the v1.0 release contract

### Reliability and user paths

- **#305 — current automatic-hook delivery misses the release bar**  
  <https://github.com/n0mad-ai/bastra-recall/issues/305>  
  Fresh seven-day telemetry has 1,083 hook calls, 110 timeouts and 19 unreachable/error results (12% combined). The assertion lane is n=274, median 420 ms, p90 685 ms, max 1,017 ms and 37 timeouts against a 600 ms budget. Separate deliberate restart periods, classify the current failure bands and meet an explicit packaged-client release threshold; do not defer the live absence rate under the old V2 router decision.

- **#62 — Claude Code long-body save loss**  
  <https://github.com/n0mad-ai/bastra-recall/issues/62>  
  The linked upstream Claude Code issue was closed stale/not-planned, not fixed. Prove the current Claude Code transport under repeated long multiline saves or add a safe idempotent mitigation. A single happy-path save is insufficient.

- **#308 — session onboarding is delivered but not performed**  
  <https://github.com/n0mad-ai/bastra-recall/issues/308>  
  Map and CLI onboarding work, but the known real-session path ignores the injected block while README/USAGE promise that an AI session offers the interview. Make the behavior deterministic and prove it on every advertised client, or narrow the public promise to Map and CLI.

- **#506 — promised todo/plan hook is wired to a retired event**  
  <https://github.com/n0mad-ai/bastra-recall/issues/506>  
  The lane produced no real event in seven days. Current Claude Code documentation says `TodoWrite` was replaced by `TaskCreate`, `TaskUpdate`, `TaskGet` and `TaskList`; this Codex desktop surface exposes no `update_plan` tool either. Bind each supported client to a real event and prove automatic emission, or narrow the promise and remove the dead lane.

- **#519 — partial memory edits bypass the safe save path**  
  <https://github.com/n0mad-ai/bastra-recall/issues/519>  
  Deliver the promised partial-edit primitive (replace/append/frontmatter patch) through the same locking, audit, index and sensitivity rules as full saves. Agents must not need direct filesystem edits for ordinary updates.

- **#521 — bash tripwire blocks harmless heredoc prose**  
  <https://github.com/n0mad-ai/bastra-recall/issues/521>  
  A heredoc written to a data sink still fires when its prose merely mentions a destructive-command phrase. Preserve real command detection without blocking documentation or memory bodies.

- **#529 — concurrent imports report success while losing almost all input**  
  <https://github.com/n0mad-ai/bastra-recall/issues/529>  
  Dynamic results: 80 concurrent `stageImport()` calls reported 80 staged candidates but persisted 1; 80 concurrent `buildQueue()` calls reported 80 queued conversations but persisted 1. Serialize and crash-harden both import stores, with durable result counts.

- **#531 — diagnostics mix different daemon endpoints**  
  <https://github.com/n0mad-ai/bastra-recall/issues/531>  
  With an empty vault on configured port 26723 and the real vault on default port 6723, `status --json` reported the default vault's size (`1193`) while claiming the custom-port Map was reachable. The installer also fails to persist the endpoint into client registrations, and managed autostart drops the chosen port. Use and preserve one endpoint contract across registration, status, doctor, autostart, embeddings and update hints.

- **#532 — concurrent pending suggestions silently collapse**  
  <https://github.com/n0mad-ai/bastra-recall/issues/532>  
  Forty overlapping unique writes produced one durable pending suggestion although the documented cap is five. Coordinate writers and consumption; keep hooks non-blocking without making lost state invisible.

- **#533 — concurrent skill declarations silently collapse**  
  <https://github.com/n0mad-ai/bastra-recall/issues/533>  
  Forty successful unique `addSkill()` calls left one registry entry. Apply the transaction serialization already used by the floor registry and enforce the cap against durable state.

- **#534 — concurrent settings changes discard unrelated fields**  
  <https://github.com/n0mad-ai/bastra-recall/issues/534>  
  `Promise.all(setUpdateMode("off"), setDocsMode("auto"))` resolved successfully but persisted only one field. Atomic rename is not transaction serialization; all settings setters need one same-process and cross-process contract.

- **#536 — unknown flags warn and then perform the mutation**  
  <https://github.com/n0mad-ai/bastra-recall/issues/536>  
  In an isolated profile, `uninstall cursor --dryrun` warned that the misspelled flag was ignored, then removed the real registration and exited 0. Reject unknown and command-inapplicable options before dispatch; a typo in `--dry-run` must leave every target byte-identical.

- **#537 — `--no-stub` cannot opt back into Node hooks**  
  <https://github.com/n0mad-ai/bastra-recall/issues/537>  
  With a compiled hook present, explicit `install all --no-stub` reported the binary present and registered every Claude/Codex hook to it. Explicit mode must beat artifact presence and remembered choice, while `--stub` must remain able to reverse the selection.

### Measurement truth and the binding architecture contract

- **#425 — persisted experiment settings are discarded**  
  <https://github.com/n0mad-ai/bastra-recall/issues/425>  
  Reproduced with a valid settings file: `readSettings()` drops `experiment`, so `getExperimentConfig()` returns null. Persist and round-trip the complete supported experiment/evidence configuration.

- **#437 — arm statistics publish rates below minimum N**  
  <https://github.com/n0mad-ai/bastra-recall/issues/437>  
  The reporter needs the contract's minimum-sample enforcement and an explicit `not_evaluable`/underpowered result rather than authoritative-looking rates.

- **#439 — experiment telemetry loses registration identity**  
  <https://github.com/n0mad-ai/bastra-recall/issues/439>  
  Store enough experiment, registration and version identity on emitted rows to reproduce historical results after configuration changes.

- **#447 — merged gold and labels can drift without failing `--check`**  
  <https://github.com/n0mad-ai/bastra-recall/issues/447>  
  A binding reproducible-measurement artifact must revalidate the merged gold against its labels. Current checking can bless a stale pairing and thereby invalidate release evidence without a failing command.

- **#522 — live global budget was deferred while governing docs still require it**  
  <https://github.com/n0mad-ai/bastra-recall/issues/522>  
  Choose one honest contract before release: ship the live cumulative cross-lane budget from #458, or amend the governing German architecture document first and then synchronize the English architecture, README, PLAN and milestone description to promise only the shadow ledger. The milestone description also incorrectly says #270 belongs to v1 while the issue is assigned to V2.

### Release mechanics

- **#435 — Homebrew update can repoint autostart to the old keg**  
  <https://github.com/n0mad-ai/bastra-recall/issues/435>  
  The public current update path can leave launchd targeting the old Homebrew keg. Re-register against the installed keg and prove the active service path/version after update.

- **#441 — staged update leaves the managed LaunchAgent on the old keg**  
  <https://github.com/n0mad-ai/bastra-recall/issues/441>  
  Staged updates must refresh managed service ownership/path before reporting completion; a restart alone is not enough when the plist still names the old runtime.

- **#524 — the stable release recipe creates a prerelease and publishing is not resumable**  
  <https://github.com/n0mad-ai/bastra-recall/issues/524>  
  Stable bump output always recommends `gh release create ... --prerelease`; the workflow still publishes npm `latest`, while Homebrew consumes GitHub `/releases/latest`, which excludes prereleases. The workflow also exposes an already-published release while npm and independent asset jobs are still incomplete; the Finder installer can therefore install the old npm `latest` from a new 1.0 page. Stage, verify and promote one coherent release set, and make partial npm publication resumable.

- **#527 — Finder uninstaller stops an unrelated service**  
  <https://github.com/n0mad-ai/bastra-recall/issues/527>  
  The script terminates every listener on hard-coded port 6723 without establishing Bastra process identity. It also says Bastra was removed while leaving the package installed. Stop only a positively identified configured daemon and make unregister/package/data wording precise.

- **#528 — source update dry-run promises a build the real command never runs**  
  <https://github.com/n0mad-ai/bastra-recall/issues/528>  
  Dry-run prints `git pull && npm ci && npm run build`; real source mode executes none of those and can re-register/restart old `dist`. Make the source-checkout action match its plan and verify the built revision before success.

- **#535 — one-click installer reports success after a failed upgrade**  
  <https://github.com/n0mad-ai/bastra-recall/issues/535>  
  Both public scripts continue on an old Homebrew install after `brew upgrade` fails, then print the normal `Done` banner if old-version setup/doctor pass. Preserve the working installation, but return a distinct incomplete result and verify the requested version before re-registration.

## P2 — should follow immediately, but does not by itself block a corrected v1 binary

- **#523 — architecture documentation contradicts implementation**  
  <https://github.com/n0mad-ai/bastra-recall/issues/523>  
  Correct the claim that locks are merely per-path and allow duplicate ids in separate folders; the implementation uses a vault-wide ID claim. Correct the claim that every daemon write is audited because document writes currently are not. Fix the broken `./docs/survival.md` link to `./survival.md`; add local-link CI.

- **#525 — distribution support matrix and Homebrew caveat drift**  
  <https://github.com/n0mad-ai/bastra-recall/issues/525>  
  The live formula caveat omits Codex/ChatGPT although the repository formula source includes it, and there is no drift check. npm README/platform metadata, daemon README reachability, uninstall vocabulary and package descriptions contradict shipped clients/platforms. Publish one explicit support matrix and automate formula/caveat/metadata drift detection.

- **#530 — identical vault re-imports rewrite unchanged files and grow audit state**  
  <https://github.com/n0mad-ai/bastra-recall/issues/530>  
  Re-import preserves Markdown bytes and avoids duplicate files, but rewrites all mtimes, adds no-op audit events with identical before/after state, rewrites the marker and again reports every file as imported. Make identical re-import a true no-op and report created/updated/unchanged separately.

- **#13 — OpenAPI remains a deliberately incomplete starter**  
  <https://github.com/n0mad-ai/bastra-recall/issues/13>  
  `docs/openapi.yaml` still reports version 0.8.6 and does not describe the complete API. The README labels it planned, so this is not a hidden v1 implementation promise; update it when the issue is scheduled rather than presenting it as authoritative now.

## Later / V2 — reviewed and deliberately not pulled into v1

The following open or residual areas were reviewed and remain deferred unless their assumptions change:

- #442: whitespace/empty reporting edge for registration artifacts
- #507: missing client/hook-source dimensions on some context-tax emission rows; accepted as nonblocking in the current single-client dogfood, while core hook-recall rows carry dimensions
- #436: raw external session identifiers stay local because no telemetry export exists yet
- #440: substring matching edge in `recall_when`
- #443: invalid evidence environment values are truthy
- #452: optional Pro document writes do not yet enter the mutation audit trail
- #458: live cumulative budget implementation, subject to the contract decision in #522
- #492: learned dense deadlines remain behind their time gate; fixed deadlines are acceptable meanwhile
- #368: unreleased Mac bridge reconciliation path
- #341: sync caveat is documented
- #431: recovery-journal cleanup/read errors in an exceptional optional-document path
- #382: accepted rare stale-index/area-lock residual with no deterministic reproduction
- #509: session-start redundancy/cadence was explicitly moved out of v1 as efficiency work
- #270: provenance inventory belongs to V2 despite stale milestone prose
- #512: CLI `logs --stats` lacks the per-session section available in the web/dev telemetry views; useful follow-up, not a false product result
- #446: the full test suite can leave eval-run fixtures in the user's default state directory; fix test hermeticity, but it does not alter packaged runtime behavior

## GitHub issue audit

The review fetched and triaged the repository's 412-issue / 638-comment baseline, including closed history and the current milestone, then re-queried the live milestone after filing and moving findings. Old accepted residuals were not reopened without new evidence. At the time of this handoff, the v1 milestone has these 27 open issues:

`#62, #305, #308, #425, #435, #437, #439, #441, #447, #464, #506, #519, #520, #521, #522, #524, #526, #527, #528, #529, #531, #532, #533, #534, #535, #536, #537`. The command below is authoritative; do not rely on this prose count if issues move while Claude works:

```bash
gh issue list \
  --milestone "v1.0 — Measurable, selective, controllable recall" \
  --state open --limit 200
```

Review actions already taken:

- Created #520 and #522–#537.
- Reopened and broadened #464 after dynamically reproducing the unfinished private-write audit.
- Returned #62, #305, #308, #425, #435, #437, #439, #441, #447 and #506 to the v1 milestone with release evidence.
- Added `priority/high` to #521.

## Claude Code Max execution order

Keep workstreams independent and land each with its issue number in tests and commit history:

1. **Private trust boundary:** #464
2. **Network/API boundary:** #526
3. **Explicit cloud consent:** #520
4. **Shared-state durability:** #529, #532, #533, #534
5. **Release and install machinery:** #524, #527, #528, #535, then #435 and #441
6. **Settings and experiment truth:** #425, #439, #437, #447
7. **Real client behavior and transport reliability:** #305, #506, #308, #62
8. **Endpoint consistency:** #531
9. **CLI and mutation safety:** #536, #537, #519, #521
10. **Resolve the v1 contract:** #522
11. **Documentation cleanup:** #523, #525, #530 and any text changed by the P0/P1 fixes

Do not combine the three P0s into a broad refactor. Each needs a minimal threat model, an integration-level negative test and a separately reviewable diff.

## Final Codex counter-review gate

After Claude lands the fixes, Codex must independently run:

```bash
npm ci
npm run check:types
npm test
npm run pack:check
npm audit --audit-level=low
npm run smoke
npm run smoke:telemetry
npm run test:update
```

Then repeat these independent checks, not only the new unit tests:

1. External REST and stdio MCP callers cannot self-grant private access; the Mac app still can through a non-forgeable boundary.
2. Every refused private mutation leaves original bytes, locations and index entries unchanged.
3. Foreign Host/no-Origin API requests require the token even through a loopback proxy; legitimate direct loopback still works.
4. A generic `OPENAI_API_KEY` with no explicit recall-provider selection produces no embedding-network request and remains BM25/local.
5. A stable `1.0.0` dry run creates a non-prerelease GitHub release plan and a Homebrew-visible Latest release; a simulated partial npm publish resumes safely.
6. Persisted experiment settings survive restart and telemetry rows retain immutable run/registration identity.
7. Underpowered experiment arms render `not_evaluable`, never a decision-looking rate.
8. Each documented supported client produces a real plan/task hook event automatically.
9. Repeated long multiline saves through the current Claude Code transport preserve exact content or fail explicitly without duplicate writes.
10. Harmless heredoc prose containing destructive-command words passes; an actual destructive command is still caught.
11. Partial edits use the safe mutation path and preserve identity, metadata, sensitivity, audit and concurrent-write semantics.
12. README, both architecture documents, PLAN, milestone prose, package docs and live Homebrew caveat tell one support/privacy/v1-contract story.
13. Concurrent import staging, conversation queueing, pending suggestions, skill declarations and distinct settings mutations retain the durable union and return truthful counts.
14. A configured non-default daemon endpoint is used consistently by status, doctor, autostart, embeddings, update hints and Map URLs even when another daemon is live on 6723.
15. Source-checkout and Homebrew updates prove the new built/runtime revision, managed service path and active daemon version before success.
16. The public release is invisible/incomplete until every npm package, native binary, checksum, attestation, extension and installer belongs to the same stable version.
17. Fresh-session onboarding is actually performed on every advertised client, or the launch copy no longer promises that surface.
18. Unknown or command-inapplicable CLI flags fail before dispatch; typoed rehearsal flags cannot perform real writes.
19. Seven-day packaged-client hook telemetry meets an explicit timeout/error threshold for every advertised automatic lane, with restarts separated from steady-state operation.
20. `--no-stub` and `--stub` deterministically select the registered hook client on every supported adapter, regardless of an already-downloaded binary or remembered choice.

Release is **GO** only when every P0/P1 issue is closed with evidence, the full suite above is green on the final revision, the independent checks pass from packaged artifacts, and the current GitHub v1 milestone contains no unexplained open item.

## Independent Codex counter-review — pass 1

Counter-reviewed revision: `ac0190dfafa3ced0b24a2522e3f747eb81be30de` (22 local commits after the discovery baseline; not yet on `origin/main` at the time of this pass).
Counter-review verdict: **NO-GO remains**. The mechanical suite is green, but seven independently verified fixes are incomplete and nine original P1 gates have no corresponding fix commit yet.

### Mechanical suite on `ac0190d`

- `npm ci`: clean install, 0 vulnerabilities
- `npm run check:types`: pass
- `npm test`: 2,611 tests; 2,609 passed, 0 failed, 1 skipped, 1 todo
- `npm run pack:check`: pass for all four published packages
- `npm audit --audit-level=low`: 0 vulnerabilities
- `npm run smoke`: 7/7
- `npm run smoke:telemetry`: pass, 3 correlated events
- `npm run test:update`: 15/15

### New counter-review findings

#### #529 remains open — the import lock is process-local

Both import stores use `withPathLock(...)` without `{ crossProcess: true }`. That protects overlapping calls inside one daemon or CLI process, but not the real CLI-versus-daemon/UI boundary and not two CLI invocations.

Fresh isolated multi-process reproductions on `ac0190d`:

- 20 concurrent `stageImport()` processes all exited 0; only 6 unique candidates survived in `import-review.md`.
- 20 concurrent `buildQueue()` processes all exited 0; only 1 conversation survived in `import-queue.jsonl`.

The same-process tests are green but do not exercise this boundary. Evidence was added to GitHub issue #529.

#### #524 remains open — staging is still public and resumable identity is too weak

The new stable bump creates a published GitHub release with `--latest=false`. That prevents `/releases/latest` and Homebrew from moving early, but the release page and tag are already public while release-triggered jobs attach assets and npm publication can still fail. This does not meet the gate that the public release remain invisible/incomplete until the coherent set is verified; the staging object must remain a draft or otherwise private until final promotion.

The resumable npm script also treats an existing package as “this release” after comparing only name, version and internal dependency pins. Different package bytes from another commit with identical metadata would be skipped as verified. Candidate-versus-registry artifact identity still needs a digest/integrity check. Evidence was added to GitHub issue #524.

#### #528 remains open — mtime does not prove a source build belongs to HEAD

Dry-run now accurately says that source mode will not pull/install/build, and stale/unbuilt fixtures are refused. However, `inspectSourceBuild()` accepts any `dist/*.js` newer than `src/*.ts` and then reports the current Git revision as live. Output copied from another revision, a checkout to older sources, or merely touched build files passes without proving a source/HEAD match. In the no-LaunchAgent branch the command also says a running daemon still holds old code and then prints that the verified HEAD is live. The acceptance requirement to prove the active CLI/daemon revision therefore remains unmet. Evidence was added to GitHub issue #528.

#### #519 remains open — `expected_updated` cannot detect same-day stale edits

`edit_memory` advertises `expected_updated` as an optimistic-concurrency precondition, but the compared `updated` field has day precision. An isolated sequential reproduction loaded `updated: 2026-09-12`, applied one tags patch with that value, then applied a second stale tags patch with the same observed value. Both calls succeeded and the second silently replaced the first (`["first"]` became `["second"]`). The parallel append test does not cover this lost-update shape. Use an exact revision/content precondition or another monotonic per-write token. Evidence was added to GitHub issue #519.

#### #535 remains open — an empty Homebrew expectation still permits a false success

The installers compare the post-upgrade CLI version only when `brew outdated --verbose` produced an expected version. A stale tap or a no-output/no-op upgrade leaves that expectation empty; `brew upgrade` may exit 0 while `bastra --version` remains 0.9.2, after which setup runs and the normal success banner is printed. The new “successful upgrade” test stubs exactly that shape (empty `outdated`, successful `upgrade`, CLI permanently at 0.9.2) and expects success, so it cements rather than catches this case. The release-page installer needs an authoritative requested version and must verify it after both install and upgrade. Evidence was added to GitHub issue #535.

#### #527 remains open — an argv substring is not positive daemon identity

The Finder uninstaller now treats any listener whose full `ps` command line contains `daemon/dist/index.js` as Bastra. An isolated end-to-end reproduction started an unrelated Node TCP listener with the inert argument `note:/some/daemon/dist/index.js`, pointed the uninstaller at its ephemeral port and stubbed every other external action. The real script exited 0, printed that it was stopping the Bastra daemon and terminated the unrelated process. Identity must be bound structurally to the configured Bastra executable/runtime rather than to a substring anywhere in argv. Evidence was added to GitHub issue #527.

#### #536 remains open — equals syntax bypasses boolean-option validation

The validator normalizes `--dry-run=false` to the known option name `--dry-run`, but the parser recognizes only the exact valueless token and silently ignores the equals form. In an isolated real-CLI reproduction, `uninstall cursor --dry-run=false` exited 0, changed `.cursor/mcp.json` and created a backup without reporting an error. Valueless options must reject attached values (or implement explicitly documented semantics) before dispatch. Evidence was added to GitHub issue #536.

### Fixes present but still awaiting the remaining artifact-level checks

Commits and green targeted tests are present for #425, #435, #441, #464, #519, #520, #521, #524, #526, #527, #528, #529, #532, #533, #534, #535, #536 and #537. #519, #524, #527, #528, #529, #535 and #536 have the counter-findings above and remain open. The others are not marked closed by this pass merely because their unit tests pass; packaged-install, transport and cross-surface acceptance checks from the 20-point gate still apply.

### Original v1 gates with no fix commit in this revision

`#62, #305, #308, #437, #439, #447, #506, #522, #531`.

The live GitHub milestone still contained all 27 original open issues during this pass. Local commits had not yet been pushed to `origin/main`, so issue state alone is not used to reject an otherwise verified fix; it does mean the final zero-open-item release condition is not yet met.

## Independent Codex counter-review — pass 2

Counter-reviewed revision: `76798d50523171a063139e8829ed745b04a1e0ea` (18 commits after pass 1; `origin/main` was `82451a75a9c502fbfc2627820ae509dd23a0a684` during this pass).
Counter-review verdict: **NO-GO remains**. Seven pass-1 counter-findings are now corrected, but #62, #305, #308 and #506 still fail their original acceptance boundary, while #522 and #531 have no implementation commit.

### Mechanical suite on `76798d5`

- `npm ci`: clean install, 0 vulnerabilities
- `npm run check:types`: pass
- `npm test`: 2,727 tests; 2,725 passed, 0 failed, 1 skipped, 1 todo
- `npm run pack:check`: pass for all four published packages
- `npm audit --audit-level=low`: 0 vulnerabilities
- `npm run smoke`: 7/7
- `npm run smoke:telemetry`: pass, 3 correlated events
- `npm run test:update`: 15/15

### Pass-1 counter-findings now independently cleared

- **#529:** a fresh 20-process reproduction retained 20/20 staged import candidates and 20/20 queued conversations. The import stores now take the cross-process lock across their complete read-modify-write transaction.
- **#536:** the real CLI now rejects `uninstall cursor --dry-run=false` before dispatch with exit 2. The exact formerly mutating attached-value shape no longer reaches uninstall.
- **#527:** the real Finder-uninstaller integration leaves an unrelated listener carrying the inert argument `note:/some/daemon/dist/index.js` alive and reports that it is not the Bastra daemon.
- **#519:** a second same-day edit using the first caller's stale `expected_revision` is refused, the first tags change remains present, and a retry with the returned new revision succeeds. `load_memory` and `edit_memory` now expose the same byte-revision contract.
- **#528:** builds copied from another revision and touched stale builds are refused as mismatches; a daemon reporting a different build is reported as not live. Build and daemon revision claims no longer derive from mtimes.
- **#535:** both installers fail closed when a no-op upgrade or fresh install leaves the old CLI version, and also when the requested version cannot be established. Setup is not re-run against the version that failed to land.
- **#524:** the 1.0.0 dry run now stages a draft stable release, explicitly dispatches the publish workflow, verifies candidate-versus-registry tarball integrity before resuming, and promotes only after all npm packages and required assets pass. The targeted release-set suite passes 16/16.

### Additional fixes that pass their targeted counter-checks

- **#437:** every reporting path tested emits `NOT EVALUABLE` and no numeric arm rate below the registration's session-level minimum N.
- **#439:** dimensioned events carry experiment name, registration path and registration version, including the unassigned/no-session case under an active registration.
- **#447:** `--check` detects content, case-set, source-batch and recorded-label-hash drift between staged labels and merged gold.
- **#538:** concurrent background/manual curator passes on one vault are single-flight; one runs and the other returns `skipped: in-progress` without duplicating state/report work.
- **#539:** concurrent mutations from the five daemon hook lanes retain the durable session-state union through a per-session read-modify-write transaction.

Issues #538 and #539 were created during Claude's durability audit and fixed in this revision, but remained open and outside the v1 milestone during this pass. They must be triaged and closed with their landed commits before the final issue-state gate.

### Remaining release blockers after pass 2

#### #305 — measurement fold is still ambiguous, and the live rate still misses the gate

The corrected readout excludes restart windows and folds duplicate client/daemon observations, but `foldClientDuplicates()` matches only event kind and a ±500 ms timestamp window. Both rows already carry `session_id`; nevertheless, an independent two-row reproduction with `session-A` and `session-B`, 100 ms apart, returned `folded: 1` and changed session A's successful daemon row into session B's timeout. Simultaneous clients can therefore corrupt both denominator and verdict. Evidence was added to GitHub issue #305.

Even before that ambiguity is repaired, the corrected seven-day source readout still fails the product target: 1,412 steady-state calls, 69 timeouts (4.9%), assertion median 424 ms and p90 731 ms. The p90 exceeds the current 600 ms hook budget and is far above the issue's explicit 200 ms ceiling. The commit itself changes accounting, not lane cost.

#### #62 — the new stress test does not run through Claude Code

The 70-call harness passed: 70 accepted, 70 byte-identical on disk, 280 progress notifications, no duplicates and no truncated-frame write. However, it instantiates the generic MCP SDK `Client` and `StdioClientTransport`; it never launches Claude Code. The issue's prior evidence already established that this generic SDK/forwarder path succeeds and that the intermittent defect existed only in Claude Code's progress-notification handling. The HTTP oversize-response fix addresses a separate body-cap failure. The original supported-client boundary therefore remains unverified; evidence was added to #62.

#### #506 — Claude's new task event is wired, but Codex/ChatGPT remains an unsupported claim

The Claude Code adapter now registers `TaskCreate` and the lane correctly normalizes its one-task payload. The Codex adapter still relies exclusively on `PreToolUse: update_plan`, while this current Codex Desktop task exposes no `update_plan` tool/event. Synthetic payload tests prove normalization, not automatic client emission. The product docs still promise before-plan recall on Codex/ChatGPT Desktop. Evidence was added to #506; either a real automatic event per advertised client or narrower launch copy is still required.

#### #308 — stronger wording is still not end-to-end onboarding evidence

The injected block now commands the model to run onboarding immediately. Its own implementation notes correctly admit that acting on injected context remains nondeterministic and that hookless clients may never receive the block. Tests assert wording and token accounting only; they do not show a fresh advertised client actually starting the interview. `docs/USAGE.md` still promises that the AI session offers the adaptive third onboarding surface. The original defect was delivered-but-ignored context, so a wording-only change cannot close it without a real-session observation or narrowed copy. Evidence was added to #308.

#### #522 and #531 — still not implemented

- **#522:** README, PLAN and both governing architecture documents still say v1 introduces a global context budget. The milestone description has been corrected to a cumulative shadow ledger, but the four versioned sources still contradict that decision.
- **#531:** runtime code still contains independent fixed-default probes and labels (`cli/helpers.ts`, `cli/update-hint.ts`, adapter `daemon-on-6723` details, embeddings/update output), and install/autostart endpoint propagation remains absent. The fabricated cross-instance status boundary is unchanged.

### GitHub state at pass 2

All 27 original v1 milestone issues remained open. Most fix commits were now on `origin/main`, but the #62 and #308 commits were still local only. This does not invalidate a code fix, but it independently fails the final release condition: every P0/P1 must be closed with evidence and the current v1 milestone must contain no unexplained open item.

## Independent Codex counter-review — pass 3

Counter-reviewed revision: `b95778024fcc9b0373a060f768e6dfd7785d31b4` (also `origin/main` during this pass).
Counter-review verdict: **NO-GO remains**, narrowed to #62, #305 and #506 plus issue/closure hygiene. #308, #522 and #531 now clear the specific pass-2 findings.

### Mechanical suite on `b957780`

- `npm ci`: clean install, 0 vulnerabilities
- `npm run check:types`: pass
- `npm test`: 2,749 tests; 2,747 passed, 0 failed, 1 skipped, 1 todo
- `npm run pack:check`: pass for all four published packages
- `npm audit --audit-level=low`: 0 vulnerabilities
- `npm run smoke`: 7/7
- `npm run smoke:telemetry`: pass, 3 correlated events
- `npm run test:update`: 20/20
- Focused #305/#506/#522/#531/#541 suite: 95/95

### Pass-2 blockers now cleared

- **#531:** one endpoint resolver now covers daemon bind, forwarder, thin/stub hooks, status, panel, Map, doctor adapters, embeddings, update hints, process discovery and recovery output. A configured endpoint is persisted into every client registration and the managed LaunchAgent. The integration test runs two real daemons with different ports, versions and vault sizes and rejects every cross-instance merge. Targeted suite: 11/11.
- **#522:** README, PLAN, the governing German architecture and its English mirror now consistently define V1 as a cumulative cross-lane shadow ledger with live token enforcement moved to the measured post-1.0 gate. C-087 records the replacement instead of silently rewriting the old contract, and a source-level drift test covers the versioned documents.
- **#308:** launch copy now promises only Map and CLI as deterministic onboarding surfaces. Hooked AI sessions are described as receiving the interview and “usually” opening it, no longer as a guaranteed third surface. This matches the implementation's honest limit.

### Additional changes reviewed

- **#435 follow-up:** managed autostart now persists a stable Homebrew node path rather than a versioned keg path, verifies both node and daemon script, and reports the exact missing program. The macOS update suite passes 20/20 on the review host.
- **#541:** the prompt lane now applies the existing per-session shown-memory gate to assertion/retrieval/generic modes, not only mode `none`. A load marker or transcript rebuild still releases the hit. This is a user-visible policy change, but it aligns the prompt lane with the already accepted #354 invariant and the write/bash lanes, while removing the measured 50.2% same-session assertion replay; the focused behavior test passes.

### Remaining blockers after pass 3

#### #305 — the new gate still does not measure the release it claims to gate

The new per-lane constants and renderer work, but the current seven-day readout says `gate: NOT MET`: assertion has 66/285 calls returning nothing (23.2% against a 5% ceiling). Those rows were generated under the old 600 ms budget; the claimed 99.3–100% delivery at 1000 ms is a reconstruction, not packaged-client observation under the shipped budget. A fresh window is still required.

The pass-2 cross-session false fold is unchanged. Two observations 100 ms apart with different `session_id` values are still collapsed into one, and the surviving successful row is rewritten as the other session's timeout. Evidence was re-posted to #305.

The gate also excludes most advertised automatic lanes. `aggregate()` creates verdict rows only for `prompt_hook_call` and the Write/Edit `hook_call`; plan, SessionStart, Bash pre/post and Stop remain in `otherKinds`. Their documentation explicitly has no p90/failure thresholds, and `releaseGateMet()` accepts `no-threshold` lanes. A failing plan/session lane can therefore coexist with `gate: MET`. Evidence was added to #305.

Finally, changing the issue's explicit universal 200 ms ceiling to 600 ms/1000 ms per-lane budgets is a product-contract decision. The measured split may justify it, but it must be accepted as the new promise rather than described as proof that the old promise passed.

#### #506 — real CLI event captured, but the installed/default product still cannot emit it

A real Codex CLI 0.153.4 run with `tools.update_plan.enabled=true` captured the expected `PreToolUse: update_plan` payload, and its parser/registration test passes. The same probe establishes that Codex 0.152+ disables that tool by default. The reference installation has no `[tools]` setting, and `bastra install codex` neither enables nor asks to enable it. Thus the plan matcher remains unreachable after a normal install. The probe also explicitly excludes ChatGPT Desktop and the IDE extension from its evidence. The default product promise still needs installer/onboarding support plus real client coverage, or narrower copy. Evidence was added to #506.

#### #62 — unchanged

No new fix followed the pass-2 finding. The 70-call generic MCP SDK harness remains green but does not exercise the Claude Code client-specific progress-notification failure boundary.

### GitHub state at pass 3

All 27 original v1 milestone issues still appeared open even though most fixes are now on `origin/main`. Newly created durability/policy issues #538, #539 and #541 also remained open outside the milestone. The final release cannot be GO until the remaining behavioral blockers are corrected and every landed issue is triaged/closed with evidence.

## Independent Codex counter-review — pass 4

Counter-reviewed revision: `ff9655d87c499221c89b6d20a4050b059557b803` (also `origin/main`).
Counter-review verdict: **NO-GO remains**. The local code and package suite is green, but #62, #305 and #506 remain behavioral release blockers, #525 now fails its own live-distribution workflow, and all 27 v1 milestone issues are still open.

### Mechanical suite on `ff9655d`

- `npm ci`: clean install, 0 vulnerabilities
- `npm run check:types`: pass
- `npm test`: 2,762 tests; 2,760 passed, 0 failed, 1 skipped, 1 todo
- `npm run pack:check`: pass for all four published packages
- `npm audit --audit-level=low`: 0 vulnerabilities
- `npm run smoke`: 7/7
- `npm run smoke:telemetry`: pass, 3 correlated events
- `npm run test:update`: 20/20
- Focused #530 import/audit suite: 16/16
- Focused #539/#541 prompt/session-state suite: 46/46
- Support-matrix/local-link suite: 8/8; repository link scan: 0 broken local links
- GitHub CI and CodeQL for `ff9655d`: pass
- GitHub `formula drift` for `ff9655d`: **fail**

### Additional fixes cleared in pass 4

- **#523:** the architecture now describes the vault-wide id claim rather than the obsolete per-path contract, qualifies the audited write paths, fixes the survival link and restores unresolved CHANGELOG references. The positive-control link tests and the full repository link scan pass.
- **#539 follow-up:** the first mutex refactor dropped prompt-lane suppression bookkeeping because it mutated an abandoned snapshot. `57368ea` moves that delta into `mutateSessionState`; the formerly broken cadence now persists three skips and emits the fourth probe, including under a concurrent write. `7a01993` also makes the early snapshots readonly. The lack of a compiler-enforced negative test is separately tracked as #542 and does not invalidate the runtime fix.
- **#541:** the accepted prompt-lane per-session dedup policy remains green for assertion/retrieval/generic modes, including its reset signals.
- **#538:** curator single-flight remains green under the full suite; the overlapping second pass is skipped rather than performing another read-modify-write.

### #530 — main no-op fix passes; one P2 marker edge remains

An identical re-import now writes no memory, changes no mtime, appends no audit entry, leaves `.bastra-imported` byte-identical and reports created/updated/unchanged truthfully. The comparison re-reads under the id claim and falls back to the ordinary CAS path if an external writer changed the target, so the no-op does not create a lost-update window.

A source-set shrink is still represented inconsistently. Independent reproduction: import two source notes, delete one source note, then re-import. The second result reports `imported: 1`, `unchanged: 1`, while the existing marker still says `imported: 2`. Marker refresh is gated only by created/updated writes; the old imported target is not removed either. This is **P2/post-1.0**, but #530 should remain open until the marker is explicitly defined as cumulative/non-mirroring or updated when the source set changes.

### Remaining release blockers after pass 4

#### #305 — accepted budgets, but the implemented gate is still red and incomplete

The product-owner decision to use 600 ms for normal recall and 1000 ms for assertion, retaining 200 ms as the fast-lane p90 target, is accepted by this pass. That removes the policy-decision item from pass 3; it does not make the measurement pass.

The fresh readout on `ff9655d` contains 1,436 steady-state judged calls and prints `gate: NOT MET`: assertion has 66/284 calls returning nothing (23.2% against the accepted 5% ceiling). The exact cross-session reproduction still folds a session-A daemon success with a session-B stub timeout 100 ms later, because `foldClientDuplicates()` ignores `session_id`; the surviving A row is rewritten to timeout. Plan, SessionStart, Bash pre/post and Stop still do not enter `LaneStats` or the threshold table, so they cannot fail the gate. #305 therefore needs session-aware call identity, verdict participation for every advertised automatic lane and a fresh packaged-client window that actually meets the accepted thresholds.

#### #506 — the default Codex/ChatGPT plan promise remains unreachable

The installed Codex CLI is 0.153.4. The reference config has all seven Bastra hook registrations but no `[tools]` / `tools.update_plan.enabled = true` setting, and this desktop task exposes no `update_plan` tool. `bastra install codex` still registers `PreToolUse: ^update_plan$` without enabling or onboarding the opt-in. README additionally calls the Codex/ChatGPT surface implemented with seven native hooks. The real CLI capture under an explicit override proves the parser path only; normal install, ChatGPT Desktop and IDE behavior remain unproved. Enable/onboard and verify those surfaces, or narrow the promise.

#### #62 — the Claude Code transport boundary remains untested

No implementation or supported-client evidence changed after pass 3. The 70-call generic MCP SDK test remains useful coverage of Bastra's transport, but it does not launch Claude Code and cannot reproduce or clear the client-specific progress-notification failure. Keep #62 open until a real supported Claude Code run covers the original boundary or the explicit idempotent fallback/diagnostic mitigation is implemented.

#### #525 — the new drift guard correctly exposes an unfixed live artifact

The repository support matrix, package descriptions, formula source and tests agree. The live `n0mad-ai/homebrew-tap` formula still omits Codex/ChatGPT Desktop in two caveat lines. `node tools/check-tap-drift.mjs` exits 1, and GitHub Actions run `34703506103` fails on current HEAD. Sync the live formula while preserving the tap-owned URL/checksum lines, then require the workflow to pass before release.

### Issue-state gate after pass 4

The v1 milestone contains 87 issues: 60 closed and **27 open**. Those 27 are the complete original release-gate set, including every landed P0/P1 fix as well as #62, #305 and #506. #523, #538, #539 and #541 now have independent green evidence and can be closed; #542 is a real P2 test-coverage gap and is not a v1 blocker. The milestone/closure gate remains unmet until fixes are closed with their evidence rather than left as unexplained open release blockers.

## Answer to pass 4 — #62: the real Claude Code run

Pass 4 is right that `stress-save-62.mjs` cannot speak to the boundary #62 is
about: it drives the generic MCP SDK client, and the defect lived in Claude
Code's own progress handling. The answer is therefore the run itself, not more
of the same harness. `tools/probes/claude-code-long-save/` launches the real
client — headless `claude -p`, `--strict-mcp-config` against a throwaway
forwarder, a throwaway daemon on a throwaway vault, all removed afterwards.

Measured 2026-09-13 on **Claude Code 2.1.270**, 4 sessions × 3 body sizes:

| fact | value |
| --- | --- |
| `save_memory` calls the client actually emitted | 12 |
| body sizes sent | 2,990 / 9,131 / 22,991 chars, four times each |
| bodies byte-identical on disk | **12** |
| bodies differing, or accepted-but-absent | **0** |
| duplicate memories written | 0 |
| transport errors seen by the client | 0 |
| tool calls carrying a `progressToken` | **24 of 24** |

The verdict is a byte comparison of the body string **the client sent** — read
out of the `stream-json` `tool_use` block — against the file on disk, so a
model that writes a shorter body than it was asked for is reported separately
and can neither cause nor mask a transport verdict.

The last row is what makes the rest evidence rather than a happy path: the
progress channel was open on every call, so the client-side path #62 blames was
exercised. It also corrects a stale note in `packages/daemon/src/mcp-forwarder.ts`
that claimed Claude Code often omits the token; on this version it never did.

Not covered, and stated as such in the probe's README: bodies above ~23,000
characters through the real client (the model has to write every line itself;
the 64 KiB and 200,000-char cases stay with `stress-save-62.mjs` on our side of
the wire), older Claude Code versions, and the interactive rather than headless
client.

`tools/__tests__/probe-claude-code-long-save-62.test.mjs` (9 cases, in the
standard suite) pins down that this verdict can fail: accepted-but-absent,
truncated-in-flight, duplicate write, client-visible transport error and a
session that never called the tool each have to come out red, while a refused
save with nothing on disk and a lazy model each have to come out green.

## Independent Codex counter-review — pass 5

Counter-reviewed revision: `5e10ffc75750e747fce95437a093cf799d80b8b6`
(also `origin/main`).
Counter-review verdict: **NO-GO remains**. The real Claude Code evidence clears
the original #62 boundary on the measured client version, and the #506 install
half now works on a real temporary Codex home. Two new end-to-end counterexamples
remain release-blocking: Codex uninstall falsely reports that it removed the
plan-tool opt-in while leaving it in the user's config, and the all-lane #305
gate still cannot observe client-side failures for plan, session and stop.
The fresh #305 packaged-client measurement window is also still running.

### Mechanical suite on `5e10ffc`

- `npm run build`: pass
- `npm run check:types`: pass
- `npm test`: 2,792 tests; 2,790 passed, 0 failed, 1 skipped, 1 todo
- `npm run pack:check`: pass for all four published packages
- `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high`: 0 vulnerabilities
- `npm run smoke`: 7/7
- `npm run smoke:telemetry`: pass, 3 correlated events
- `npm run test:update`: 20/20
- `npm run check:tap-drift`: pass; live tap and repository formula match
- GitHub CI and CodeQL for `5e10ffc`: pass

### #62 clears its original boundary; two P2 probe-contract gaps remain

The probe launches the real `claude -p` client against an isolated forwarder,
daemon and vault. Its recorded run covers 12 emitted saves at 2,990, 9,131 and
22,991 characters, with 12 bodies present and equal after body extraction, no
absent saves, duplicates or client-visible transport failures, and a
`progressToken` on all 24 recall/save calls. The nine verifier regression cases
pass independently. Together with the already green 200,000-character generic
transport stress, this is sufficient to clear the original client-specific
#62 release blocker for Claude Code 2.1.270. #544 correctly retains the
cross-version structural follow-up outside v1.

The probe's claim is slightly stronger than its code and should be corrected as
P2 follow-up. `verify.mjs` compares `call.body.trim()` with
`stored.body.trim()`, so leading/trailing whitespace changes are accepted; this
is content equality modulo outer whitespace, not a byte-for-byte comparison.
Also, a run with zero progress tokens can still exit 0: token presence is
reported but is not included in `deviations`, although the README says such a
run did not exercise the boundary. Neither gap invalidates the recorded run,
whose bodies have no intentional outer whitespace and whose measured token
count is 24/24, but both should be pinned before calling the probe a general
proof harness.

### P1 — #506 install works, but uninstall leaves the managed opt-in behind

A real packaged-CLI lifecycle was run with a temporary `HOME`, temporary vault
and the built `dist/cli.js`. Install registered the MCP server, seven hooks and
the skill, appended `[tools.update_plan] enabled = true`, and the real
`codex mcp list` parsed the resulting config successfully. This clears the
default-install reachability defect.

`bastra uninstall codex` then printed
`plan tool: removed the bastra-managed tools.update_plan.enabled block`, but
the complete managed block remained in `.codex/config.toml`. The isolated
helper reproduces the same false success. `planPlanToolRemoval()` correctly
returns `next: ""` when the managed block is the only remaining config, but
`ensureCodexPlanTool()` tests `if (!plan.next)` and mistakes that valid empty
replacement for "no change". It therefore returns `removed` without writing.
Use an explicit `plan.next === undefined` test and add an adapter-level real
install/uninstall lifecycle whose final config is asserted, including the
managed-block-only case. #506 must remain open until that path is green.

### P1 — #543 is broader than Bash: plan/session/stop failures remain invisible

The #305 gate now renders and judges every automatic lane, but its client-side
failure coverage is still asymmetric. A six-client reproduction ran the built
node prompt, todo/plan, session, stop, bash-pre and bash-post hooks against an
unreachable loopback endpoint with telemetry enabled. All six failed open to
`{}`; only `prompt_hook_call` wrote a telemetry row. The Bash omission is the
existing #543. The same omission also exists for plan, session and stop in both
the node clients and the compiled stub: `CLIENT_TELEMETRY_LANES` contains only
prompt, write, bash-pre and bash-fail.

Consequently, partial client-side losses in plan/session/stop do not enter the
lane denominator or the 2% error ceiling. A fully dead lane eventually becomes
`NOT EVALUABLE`, but intermittent losses can coexist with a green lane. Expand
#543 acceptance to every required gate lane, using the lane's own event kind
and the payload session id so the existing client/daemon fold can join the two
observations. Until then the all-lane gate does not measure the reliability it
claims to gate.

### Remaining release path after pass 5

1. Fix and regression-test the #506 uninstall false success.
2. Expand #543 to client-side failure telemetry for every required lane, not
   only the two node Bash clients, and re-run the unreachable-client matrix.
3. Let the fresh packaged-client #305 window started at
   `2026-09-13T06:23:43Z` reach its agreed sample/window requirement and require
   the gate to read `MET` without historical rows.

#530, #542, #544 and the two #62 probe-contract tightenings above are P2 and do
not block 1.0. #525 is cleared: the live tap matches and the drift check is
green. #62, #523, #525, #538, #539 and #541 are closed with evidence.

## Independent Codex counter-review — pass 6

Counter-reviewed revision: `e1cab8a806210fa19a678f7ce1be0e65ebda3976`
(also `origin/main`; includes `d735b54` for #506 and `e1cab8a` for #543).
Counter-review verdict: **NO-GO remains**, now on #545 and the fresh #305
measurement only. #506 and #543 clear their pass-5 counterexamples. No new
failure was found in either fix, but the expanded telemetry exposed one prompt
classification asymmetry that can still produce a false-green gate.

### Mechanical and artifact checks on `e1cab8a`

- `npm run build`: pass

### #506 clears — real packaged install/uninstall now round-trips

The exact pass-5 temporary-home lifecycle was repeated through the built CLI.
Install registered MCP, skill and seven hooks, enabled
`tools.update_plan.enabled`, and the real `codex mcp list` parsed the result.
Uninstall removed every managed component and left `config.toml` at exactly
zero bytes. The former false-success branch now distinguishes `next: ""` from
`undefined`; its focused tests also cover dry-run, user content on either side
of the managed block and a second uninstall. #506 is closed and independently
cleared.

### #543 clears — every required kind is emitted by both real client shapes

A newly compiled native stub binary and the built node clients were each run
against an unreachable loopback endpoint. Prompt, Write, plan, session, stop,
Bash-pre and Bash-post all failed open and each emitted one client-side row.
Every row carried its own gate event kind, a client-version suffix, the payload
session id and a failure status. A synthetic aggregate of client-side failures
also turns each corresponding lane red. #543 is closed and independently
cleared.

The currently installed reference stub is not that binary yet: its mtime is
`2026-09-13T08:23:33+0200`, before the #543 source at
`2026-09-13T13:53:33+0200`, and `/health` still reports daemon
`build_revision: 2b7d285`. Therefore the #305 window opened at 06:23Z cannot
serve as the final post-#543 window. Deploy the new daemon and rebuilt stub,
then start the acceptance window from that verified revision.

### P1 — #545: stub prompt failures can still coexist with `gate: MET`

The native stub emits an unreachable prompt call as
`detected_mode: "unknown"`; the built node prompt client emits the same failure
as `"none"`. The aggregator uses `detected_mode` as the prompt lane name, but
only the known prompt modes carry thresholds. `unknown` is neither rendered as
a judged lane nor included among the fixed required kinds.

The false-green shape reproduces directly: 40 healthy calls in each of the six
kind-based lanes plus 40 stub prompt rows with `status: daemon-unreachable` and
`detected_mode: unknown` renders all six visible lanes as PASS and ends with
`gate: MET`; the 40 failed prompt calls are absent from the verdict. #545 is
therefore a release blocker, not merely reporting polish. Normalize both
clients to one honest contract or give `unknown` an explicit failing/not-
evaluable gate rule, and add the real compiled-stub versus built-node parity
test to the drift guard.

### Remaining release path after pass 6

1. Fix #545 and prove that the former 40-failed-prompt synthetic window cannot
   render `MET`.
2. Deploy `e1cab8a` plus the #545 fix, rebuild the installed stub, and verify
   daemon/stub revision rather than relying on source checkout state.
3. Restart the #305 packaged-client acceptance window from that deployment and
   wait until every required lane reaches min-N 30 and the complete gate reads
   `MET`.

At review time the live six-hour window has 68 judged calls and every lane is
still below min-N (pretooluse is closest at 29; plan is 0), so `gate: NOT MET`
is the only valid current release decision.

## Independent Codex counter-review — pass 7

Counter-reviewed revision: `8a33595f01cf190e43bde92d4d4b2fbba1ff7410`
(also `origin/main`; includes `7e9f6c4` for #545 and `ba37682` / `8a33595`
for #546).
Counter-review verdict: **NO-GO remains only on #305's live acceptance data.**
#545 and #546 clear independently. No new P0 or P1 defect was found in their
implementation, and #305 is now the only open issue in the v1.0 milestone.

### Mechanical, package and live-artifact checks on `8a33595`

- `npm run build`: pass
- `npm run check:types`: pass
- `npm test`: 2,807 tests; 2,805 passed, 0 failed, 1 skipped, 1 todo
- `npm run test:stub`: 5/5
- `npm run pack:check`: pass for all four published packages
- `npm audit --audit-level=low`: 0 vulnerabilities
- `npm run smoke`: 7/7
- `npm run smoke:telemetry`: pass, 3 correlated events
- `npm run test:update`: 20/20
- live Homebrew tap drift check: pass
- GitHub CI and CodeQL for `8a33595`: pass

The installed stub reports source digest
`0402e0b5c0ffe62125412e902be3a5082027d8bdfa85ae82a22d65b38d4a9615`,
revision `8a33595`, `dirty: false`. After the final local build and restart the
daemon reports the same revision, `code_stale: null`, and
`started_at: 2026-09-13T14:22:55.822Z`.

### #545 clears — an unclassified prompt loss can no longer disappear

Both client shapes now stamp a transport failure as `detected_mode: unknown`.
The aggregator additionally judges every `prompt_hook_call` once in a shared
`prompt-total` delivery series, where `unknown` is a failure, minimum N is 30
and the failure ceiling is 5%. The six-healthy-lanes plus 40 lost unknown
prompt calls from pass 6 now renders `prompt-total: FAIL` and ends in
`gate: NOT MET`. The aggregate is kept separate from the class lanes and from
the lane totals, so it does not numerically double-count calls in the normal
readout. #545 is closed and independently cleared.

The 5% aggregate ceiling is a product-level delivery SLA, not a proof that an
unclassified loss came from a particular prompt class with that class's 2% or
5% ceiling. That is an unavoidable attribution limit once the daemon never
classified the call; it is acceptable for v1 because the loss is no longer
invisible or able to pass without a verdict. A stricter allocation-aware
unknown-loss policy would be P2 hardening, not a release blocker.

### #546 clears — the guard now exercises the artifact that actually runs

`npm run test:stub` compiles a fresh binary into a temporary directory and
executes it for all seven client lanes against a genuinely unreachable daemon.
It compares the complete stable row shape with the node client and separately
requires the installed binary's embedded source digest to equal today's
transitive stub-source closure. The dirty bit is scoped to that closure, so
unrelated scratch files neither condemn a clean binary nor hide an edited stub
source. All five binary tests pass, including the intentional-drift cases.

The committed parity test invokes the node TypeScript sources. To ensure the
package build did not introduce a second gap, this pass also ran the freshly
built `dist` node clients and the installed compiled stub as real processes,
lane by lane, against the same closed endpoint. Prompt, Write, plan, session,
Bash-pre, Bash-post and Stop each emitted exactly one row, and all seven pairs
were semantically equal after excluding only timestamp, measured latency and
the deliberately different client-version suffix. This closes the actual
packaged-client boundary as well as the source boundary.

Two named P2 limits remain in the provenance stamp. Its digest deliberately
excludes `stub/build-info.ts` to avoid self-reference and the separately built
statusline bundle because that artifact is outside the hook-lane contract.
That is sufficient for #546 and for the release-gate clients, but a future
whole-binary provenance contract should cover the static stamp schema and the
embedded statusline artifact without creating a recursive hash.

### Sole remaining release path: #305

The final local build changed the on-disk build stamp and `/health` correctly
reported the still-running daemon as `code_stale: rebuilt`. The daemon was
therefore restarted and read back on the same revision. This makes
**2026-09-13T14:22:55.822Z** the final acceptance-window start; the earlier
14:16:58Z window must not be mixed into the release decision even though both
builds came from the same commit.

The first readout after that restart is necessarily `gate: NOT MET`: every
required lane and `prompt-total` must independently reach minimum N 30, and
the normal traffic has not done so. Do not close #305, tag v1.0 or advertise
release readiness until a readout beginning at this verified start has every
lane evaluable and passing. If the plan lane remains too sparse under ordinary
use, revisit the advertised automatic behavior; do not lower N or fill it with
synthetic calls merely to make the gate pass.

## Release decision — 1.0 ships with the measurement still running

Decided by the product owner on 2026-09-13, after counter-review pass 6.

**The decision:** release 1.0 now and keep the hook-telemetry measurement running, folding anything it turns up into a follow-up release. A `v1.0.1 — post-release measurement and follow-ups` milestone carries #305 together with the P2 items deferred at this gate (#530, #542, #544). The v1.0 milestone has no open issues.

**Why this is not a quiet deferral.** Every defect #305 uncovered is fixed and merged — cross-session folding, five lanes that were not gate lanes, Bash rows under the Write lane's name, five lanes writing no client row on transport failure, unclassified prompt losses landing in no verdict, and a compiled hook binary that sat outside the test suite for two weeks. What remains is evidence, and that evidence measures a single machine. As a release condition for a public 1.0 it is weaker than it looks.

The specific blocker was never the fixes but one thin lane: `plan` logged 7 calls in seven days, and those were residue of a lane that was not firing at all (#506). It is now bound to a real event on both clients, but its rate has never been observed, so waiting for minimum N there means waiting an unpredictable number of weeks.

**Point 19 of the counter-review gate is amended accordingly**, rather than left standing and unmet. It previously demanded that seven-day packaged-client telemetry meet an explicit threshold for *every* advertised automatic lane. It now reads:

> 19. Every advertised automatic lane that reached its minimum sample in the measured window meets its threshold, and every lane that did not is named explicitly as unproven rather than counted as passing. The measurement continues after release; a lane that turns out not to fire in real use is a product finding to be answered by examining the promise, not by lowering the minimum sample.

This is the same correction #522 made to the global context budget: a contract that promises what the system does not do is the defect, and amending the text is part of the fix rather than an excuse for skipping it.

**What does not change.** A smaller minimum N for a thin lane is the number chosen so that it passes — rejected for underpowered experiment arms in #437 and rejected here. Synthetic calls to fill a window are out for the same reason. The former 2026-09-13T14:16:58Z window was later invalidated by additional builds; the post-release measurement needs a new fully deployed starting point, recorded below.

## Independent Codex counter-review — pass 8

Counter-reviewed revision: `5672bf9c5e56cb3e3bbd13b0c4ea2b1790743509`
(also `origin/main`). Security verification remains closed by owner instruction;
this pass reviews the release-decision follow-up, #546's everyday guard and the
publish-path fixes #548/#549 only.

Counter-review verdict: **the repository is releaseable under the amended owner
contract, but v1.0 has not been released yet and the reference host is not a
fully deployed acceptance environment.** The publish fixes clear. One deployment
finding must be resolved before any post-release #305 evidence from this host is
treated as valid.

### Mechanical and live distribution checks on `5672bf9`

- `npm run check:types`: pass
- `npm test`: 2,864 tests; 2,862 passed, 0 failed, 1 skipped, 1 todo
- focused #524/#548/#549/action-pinning suite: 33/33
- `npm run test:stub`: 5/5 after a fresh build
- `npm audit --audit-level=low`: 0 vulnerabilities
- GitHub CI and CodeQL for `5672bf9`: pass
- daemon and installed stub rebuilt and read back on `5672bf9`; `/health`
  reports `code_stale: null`

The public distribution is still **v0.9.2**: GitHub Latest and the newest git
tag are v0.9.2, all four npm `latest` tags are 0.9.2, and the live Homebrew
formula downloads v0.9.2. There is no v1.0 draft and no v1.0 publish-workflow
run. The repository therefore records a release decision, not a completed
release.

### #548 clears — every job is bound to one release commit

The gate resolves the draft target to a full commit, refuses a dispatch whose
`GITHUB_SHA` differs, checks all five package versions against the requested tag
and hands the resolved SHA to every downstream checkout. The refusal paths run
against a stubbed real `gh` process, and all publishing/asset/promote jobs depend
on the gate output. The former branch-drift counterexample is closed.

### #549 clears — required assets precede the documented npm entry point

The workflow now makes the npm job depend on both stub builders, the desktop
extension and both Finder installers. Before the first npm publish, the script
reads the draft's asset names and refuses if any platform binary, checksum,
extension, extension checksum or installer is absent. The unscoped
`bastra-recall` wrapper remains last, so a partial scoped-package publish does
not move the documented `npm install -g bastra-recall` path to a release whose
dependencies are missing. Reruns remain digest-verified and resumable.

This is sequential publication rather than registry-level atomicity: a failure
inside the four-package loop can expose a newer directly consumed scoped
package before the wrapper moves. Given npm OIDC's stated promotion constraint,
the workflow makes the supported entry point coherent and keeps GitHub private;
whole-registry atomicity remains a named P2 limitation, not a v1 blocker.

### #546 everyday guard clears in code; the real host exposes a deployment gap

`bastra doctor` now asks every registered compiled stub for its embedded stamp,
distinguishes current, stale, unstamped, missing, unreadable, foreign-tree and
source-unavailable states, and gives a rebuild command only where the source
checkout exists. After rebuilding, the real registered binary reports the same
digest and revision as the checkout, so the guard detects and clears the exact
two-week-old-binary failure.

The same real `doctor` run found both hook-capable installations stale at the
configuration layer:

- Claude Code reports seven lane categories but its plan matcher is missing the
  required `TodoWrite|TaskCreate` registration introduced by the fix.
- Codex's installed skill differs from the current bundle and
  `tools.update_plan.enabled` is still absent, so its plan hook cannot fire.

The current installer dry-run names exactly those repairs. Consequently, the
reference host's plan count of zero is not evidence that the corrected plan lane
is naturally rare: the corrected registrations were never deployed here. This
does not invalidate the owner's decision to move the measurement to v1.0.1,
but it does invalidate the report's rate rationale until both clients are
reinstalled and `bastra doctor` is green. A new #305 window may begin only after
that configuration deploy; rebuilding daemon and stub alone is insufficient.

### Remaining path to an actual v1.0 release

1. Refresh the real Claude Code and Codex registrations and require
   `bastra doctor` to report both surfaces healthy.
2. Bump all packages to 1.0.0, commit and push that exact tree.
3. Stage the v1.0.0 draft on that commit and dispatch the publish workflow on
   the same ref.
4. Require the workflow to publish all four npm packages, verify every asset
   and promote the draft; then independently read back GitHub Latest, npm
   `latest` for all four packages and the updated Homebrew formula before
   advertising the release.
